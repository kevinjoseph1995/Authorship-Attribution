V\u000a\u000aI have asked <NAME/> to set up a meeting with you and <NAME/> on this subject.  I thought there were exclusions relative to EOL transactions and points that do not directly impact HPL.  The problem for me is that if I want to do terms deals in these locations now I want to be able to keep them as ENA and not transfer them with the HPL sale.  Let's talk as soon as possible so I can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ENA now and after the close.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI received notice today that <NAME/> Villareal , <NAME/> Lamphier and <NAME/> Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:\u000a\u000a1 Lead Physical Trader\u000a1 Physical Trader\u000a1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)\u000a\u000a1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator\u000a1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator\u000a\u000aI met with <NAME/> Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.\u000aI am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.\u000a\u000aI delivered employment contracts to <NAME/> Wallis, <NAME/> Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, <NAME/> Bass and <NAME/> Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  <NAME/> did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other <NAME/> Units have talked to her as well.\u000a\u000aAlthough we met <NAME/>'s numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.\u000a\u000aThe others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.\u000a\u000aGiven the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.\u000a\u000aI will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the info.  I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.  My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.\u000a\u000a  I only considered CR "Recomended " cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown <NAME/>/Mecury Grand <NAME/>; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the <NAME/> Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.\u000a\u000aDad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown <NAME/>/Grand <NAME/> and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.\u000a\u000aAny Thoughts?\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIf you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required <NAME/> to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep <NAME/> whole.  Any thoughts?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience.

As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than "gee, wouldn't this be cool" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project.

"\u000a\u000aThe problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.\u000a\u000aFor what it is worth.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.\u000a\u000aIf you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGuys,\u000aLet's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.\u000a\u000aI'm good from 11:00 to 1:00\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.\u000a\u000aI think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.\u000a\u000aA bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.\u000a$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.\u000a\u000aI'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aLet's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.\u000a\u000aI am in the office picking up some Stro's tix.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For <NAME/> <NAME/>'s book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. \u000a\u000aFor the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:\u000a\u000aAverage tenor: 5 months\u000a\u000aAverage trades per day: 400\u000a\u000aaverage volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu\u000a\u000aaverage px: $2.7/mmbtu\u000a\u000aWith 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7\u000a\u000aYou then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.\u000a\u000aThat takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).\u000a\u000aThe next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.\u000a\u000aAs a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI met with <NAME/> Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.\u000a\u000a1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.\u000a\u000a2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.\u000a\u000a3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.\u000a\u000a4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.\u000a\u000aIf anyone has any questions about this let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aEddie,\u000a\u000aThanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. <NAME/> all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aEddie,\u000a\u000aThanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision.

So for getting the term structure of <NAME/>'s funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Zipper\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with <NAME/> has been around for awhile.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aVin,\u000a\u000aGlad we could hook up yesterday. \u000a\u000aThe gist of what we are interested in is providing <NAME/>Online's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between <NAME/> and these locals. <NAME/>Online's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with <NAME/>. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> Zipper\u000aVice President\u000a<NAME/> Corp.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know. \u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p84
aV\u000a\u000aLet me make this clear: Accenture is not to speak to anyone other than ourselves regarding what they are doing with EnronOnline. We ahve too much at stake right now.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p85
aV\u000a\u000aWhat is, exactly, the state of play here ? I nothing else happens, on Monday does the product go up on the wallboard ? Has Eddie quoted on px to the Merc ? I need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between Whalley ,<NAME/> and Lavorato.\u000a
p86
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and Philippe\u000a\u000aHaving listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with <NAME/>, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:\u000a\u000a1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.\u000a\u000a2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.\u000a\u000a\u000aRecommendation:\u000a\u000aEnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi Mom,\u000a\u000aThings are a little better here for me, Friday was a horrible day, we had layoffs of about 30% of our office.  Lots of crying and sadness on the floor.   The weekend was strange, <NAME/> came back from <NAME/> un announced which was not what we agreed to, and I got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to 'catch' me doing something or having someone over.  He is still really struggling with the idea that I just can't love him like a wife anymore, and that is not enough to keep two people together.  I wish that I could make this easier on him, and I almost think that if I had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept.\u000a\u000aI am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt. I do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Just pray for him and for me.\u000a\u000aSchool sounds wonderful, I am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones. How fun!  \u000a\u000aI love you!\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I have so little respect for her for treating people this way.

I am glad to see that, I felt really bad for how upset he was.\u000aHe is going to go stay with his folks for a few days, they had their insurance company call and tell them that if they didn't clean up the outside of the house that they would drop them from insurance. They had a gardener come out, but <NAME/> is going to take the pressure washer down and wash the house. I personally think they need to move to a retirement apartment with some living assistance. They do not seem to have the ability to take care of anything anymore.\u000a\u000aWork is winding down, folks are bored and working on resumes and stuff.  \u000a\u000aI love you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGood Morning Honey,\u000a\u000aI didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today. However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about. Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.  Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  \u000a\u000aYou are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.  I want to tell them, "this is done" not "this is what I am going to do".  I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.\u000a\u000aI am looking forward to forever with you.\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I have been buying that good Prosperity wine at Trader Joe's and always remember the party at your house.\u000a\u000aDo you think that you will be ever coming here to visit?  How is your husband?  How is your dog-bite scar? Do you have any new Jewelry?  I am trying to sell my wedding ring, and am thinking instead that I will just get another stone to match the center stone and make earrings.\u000a\u000aIf you do come to stay, please stay with me. I am signing papers on my new condo this afteroon It is wonderful. 3 Bedrooms, backs right up to a greenbelt with a wetland.\u000a\u000aI miss you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Poo\u000a

I saw a wrapper in the trash this morning and was sad to see it there. You need to fix that ( or those as it were). Please let me know what the dr. says.\u000a\u000aThe movie sounds good, but we will see how tired you are when you get home.  I wouldn't mind laying around like a turd this evening either. I need to vacuum but that is all.\u000a\u000aI love you, and am so glad that I make you happy. I want us to be happy together for many years to come. I still feel like the luckiest woman in the world, to have such a caring and loving man in my life so suddenly.\u000a\u000aSee you tonight,\u000a\u000aC\u000a

What did I ever do to deserve you!\u000a\u000aIf we aren't too tired tonight, let's go poke around a store or something. Maybe linens and things to look for kitchen stuff??

I went to the law store and got all the documents, but I find them very intimidating. I think I would rather pay the single fee to the lawyer so that I know it is all done right. I would like your advice on this matter.\u000a \u000aI have been going to parties and movies and such,  having fun.  I have been on a date, and am currently enjoying the company of a man named <NAME/>. He is a very sweet man, and we have just clicked.\u000a \u000aTalk to you later, have a good long weekend off.

aV\u000a\u000aGood Morning Honey,\u000a\u000aI wish that I could have pulled it together enough to get up with you and take care of you this morning, I really missed that.  Thank you for waking me up and giving me kisses and love. It was a sweet way to start the day.\u000a\u000aToday there is a meeting from UBS, in about 10 minutes. I wonder what will be said. I will let you know everything.\u000a\u000aOn the way to work I was thinking about us planning for our home. I love the sound of our home. I hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today, I like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work. Soon we will both just be home.\u000a\u000aHopefully I will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to Stanfords, but if not I will meet you there at 6. If I make it to the grotto by 5, will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well?\u000a\u000aI am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication. I hope he gives me some more meds, but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized.\u000a\u000aLast night was wonderful, each time we are together I find something new to enjoy. I love being with you, holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses. You make me so happy, and I want to make you happy. I love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes. You are a wonderful man and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life.\u000a\u000aI love you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi Mom,\u000a\u000aI am amazed at those bear photos.  The entire office (what's left anyway) was around my desk looking at that.  That guy must have filled his drawers!\u000a\u000aHow is <NAME/> doing?  What shot do they think she reacted to?  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for <NAME/> and Jackie and the whole family.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is staying at <NAME/> and <NAME/>'s for the weekend, I asked him to go or let me know if he wanted to stay and I would go somewhere. I need some space and he is still so upset that my presence is not helping. It would be easier on him if I just moved out now.  I can't because he can't afford to live in the house without me, and he can't leave because you can't get an apartment in this town without a job. We will be putting the house on the market no later than the first week of January.\u000a\u000a\u000aI love you, thank you for your love and support for both of us during this very difficult time.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDear Little Sister,\u000a\u000aThank you so much for you love and support during this difficult time.  I wish that I could make this easier on everyone, but this is what has to be done.  I have no intention of separating from you or the <NAME/>/McPhersons, you all are more than family to me.  You will always be my little sister. I am going to work very hard to come through this with <NAME/> and me as much friends as possible, so that the stress to us all will be minimized.  I see no reason to hurt people over what amounts to belongings.\u000a\u000aI am glad you liked your gifts, you did save at least one to open on Christmas day, right?  I hope so.\u000a\u000aI have the house to myself this weekend, <NAME/> is at your folks to give us a little space.  He is still very upset, and I feel bad that I have made him so sad. I really didn't think he would be this upset. I am glad that the family is rallying support for him, and I have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support. He has no real friends here, and that is a big problem.\u000a\u000aI love you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a"Pizza Pie"\u000a
p207
aV\u000a\u000aThank you for your kind words.\u000a \u000aThis is the hardest decision and the most painful one I have ever had to make.  <NAME/> needs his family so much right now, as he has very few friends. Please call him often and if you can invite him down for a visit please do that.\u000a \u000aI am confident that if we are calm and peaceful through this process we can emerge on the other side as friends. \u000a \u000aI promise to do everything in my power to be kind generous and calm.\u000a \u000aLove,\u000a \u000aC\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGood Morning,\u000a\u000aDue to our current situation, I have 3 full time very talented schedulers with very little to do.

aV\u000a\u000aHi Sweetie,\u000a \u000aI still can't believe all of this, we are laying off people here left and right, our traders are trying to call in favors to find jobs for as many people as possible.\u000a \u000aWe are still trying to deliver on contracts, and not all of our counterparties have cut us off.  I can't imagine for the life of me why anyone would continue to do business with us!\u000a \u000aI love you, and <NAME/> and Riley\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis amused me this morning!\u000a\u000aOnce upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a\u000adeserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a\u000aman dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, <NAME/>-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer\u000awrist-watch, and a <NAME/> Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can\u000atell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"\u000a\u000aThe shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing\u000asheep and replies, "Okay."\u000a\u000aThe young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a\u000aNASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel\u000atables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page\u000areport on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,\u000a\u000a"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."\u000a\u000aThe shepherd answers,\u000a\u000a"That's correct, you can have your sheep."\u000a\u000aThe young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The\u000ashepherd looks at him and asks,\u000a\u000a"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man\u000aanswers, "Yes, why not?"\u000a\u000aThe shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."\u000a\u000a"How did you know?" asks the young man.\u000a\u000a"Very simple," answers the shepherd.\u000a\u000a"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell\u000ame something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my\u000afriggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am  going to ask <NAME/> W if you can be included in NewCo, but I never really asked if you wanted to be.  Do you want to be?\u000a
p240
aV\u000a\u000aLet's get on  it really seriously tomorrow.  We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.\u000a\u000aDid we send margin letters on others today as we need to.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p241
aV\u000a\u000aGood idea - let's try for that in their systems.  Its really only a question of my pay checks and expenses bouncing.\u000a\u000aHad a crap week-end filling in my SEC background questionnaire - hope yours was better.\u000a
p242
aV\u000a\u000aI am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p245
aV\u000a\u000aSo far we have spent today relooking at our numbers for the whole business.  Technology is looking about the same as before (possibly 10 -  15 less in <NAME/>'s area).  I think it would be a good idea for you to come down and have dinner with either myself or myself, <NAME/> and <NAME/> together tomorrow.

aV\u000a\u000aSorry its all prepetition.\u000a\u000aI already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.

aV\u000a\u000aKeep working the deal - I left <NAME/> a voicemail.  Now we have the cash you can work the deals at a b it slower pace - use your judgement.  I still want as much of that money as possible.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p265
aV\u000a\u000aI'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.  I would hope for a major change in format.\u000a
p266
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aFor your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know <NAME/> and <NAME/> have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> this helps.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> for East Power\u000a<NAME/> Storey for Gas \u000a<NAME/> Luce for Peoples and Global Net\u000a<NAME/> Gaskill for Gas Fundys\u000a<NAME/> Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.\u000a<NAME/> Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.\u000a\u000aEach of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from <NAME/> who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.\u000a\u000aI am assuming its zero at the moment.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am assuming one of you comes initially - you or <NAME/>.  We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.  What do you think?\u000a
p280
aV\u000a\u000aTo be honest you guys need to continue organizing this as we have no idea what is going on in the creditors committee - I didn't even know they were here until <NAME/> rang me.  You can have whichever resources you want although Berney is EES.  I would suggest you continue to lead the effort though.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMarcello is coming to <NAME/> tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  <NAME/> - what about South East power?\u000a
p284
aV\u000a\u000aSorry to mess you around on this but we have now booked the flights and we do not need the extra night - is it ok to cancel the extra night.  If possible could you please send a new confirm when you have time.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Could you let us see Kyle's request and we'll try and help from this end.  How many people is he asking for to be seconded to the Estate.  I am concerned over IT requirements as we never developed this software in the first place - it was created by Razorfish.\u000a\u000aIn terms of 5, the person dealing with this is actually Per Dyrvik who is going to set up a conference call for us this morning.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - tried to ring you.

aV\u000a\u000aThis got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.\u000a\u000aA great reflection on you guys too.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000aRef: <NAME/> Chronicle website\u000a* * * * * \u000aTuesday, Dec. 4 \u000aI was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make <NAME/> Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. \u000a* * * * *  "<NAME/> took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  <NAME/> Hommel,  former <NAME/> employee * * * * * 	\u000aWe have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at <NAME/> and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild <NAME/> Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. \u000aNow it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at <NAME/>, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at <NAME/>, but I know I won't see many of them again. <NAME/> took those friendships, <NAME/> took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. \u000aBut let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOur natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.

This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.\u000a\u000aCentral Origination and Mid-Market\u000a<NAME/> Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. \u000a \u000a\u000aThere will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by <NAME/> Tycholiz and <NAME/> Redmond. \u000a\u000aPlease join us in congratulating <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> in their new roles.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & <NAME/>\u000a

The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.\u000a\u000aCustomer Side	\u000a+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)\u000a				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)\u000a				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)\u000a+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers\u000a				Phase  2 Customers\u000a				Phase  3 Customers\u000a+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)\u000a+	Customer visit schedule\u000a\u000aProduct Side\u000a+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week\u000a				Phase 2 - First Month\u000a				Phase 3 - First Quarter\u000a\u000aTarget Number of Transactions\u000a+	Phase 1\u000a+	Phase 2\u000a+	Phase 3\u000a\u000aIT transfer \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.\u000a \u000a<NAME/> your people mopve to <NAME/>?\u000a
p316
aV\u000a\u000aThanks - I have used it already to <NAME/>.  I mentioned the <NAME/> concept - I'll let you know what he says.  <NAME/> Richter is too busy  - he runs EES in the West.  Keep thinking though I like the idea of <NAME/> or <NAME/>.\u000a
p317
aV\u000a\u000aContracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered out to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.\u000a\u000aAll agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.\u000a\u000aI will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHello <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWe would like you to price:\u000a\u000aChairs (2) \u000aThe chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000aThe sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a3 square additional pillows (2 in chair material and 1 in sofa material).\u000a\u000aWould the wood be the same in the sofa as used on the chairs?\u000a\u000aPlease could you let me know the prices.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Nettelton\u000a
p319
aV\u000a\u000aCanada appears to be an issue.\u000a\u000aWe need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.\u000a\u000aThere are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know how we can progress on this.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p320
aV\u000a\u000aIf you have an issue you need to ring <NAME/> Gonzales.\u000a\u000aHe shouldn't have had the meeting - there is a lack of integrity on this.\u000a
p321
aV\u000a\u000aCan you redraft in light of how I redrafted the other one - removing <NAME/>'s name from the first paragraph.  And resend to me\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p322
aV\u000a\u000aCould you put together  a list of all the <NAME/> Corp employees who have <NAME/> (non-<NAME/>) equipment at home.\u000a

p324
aV\u000a\u000aWe still haven't got this finalized - I'm  looking to do this this week otherwise I would have to start agreeing with <NAME/> that we have to pull them.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTheir current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.\u000a\u000aIn your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but <NAME/> tells me it was the other way.\u000a
p330
aV\u000a\u000aThe only comment  on the structures transaction slide is that \u000a\u000a(i) They are not from this quarter \u000a(ii) the Rockies Power - prebuild, I am not entirely sure what this deal is - but there was one in Washington.\u000a(iii) REmove MidWest Gas Utility Outsourcing as we haven't completed this yet - hopefully you can have it for Q4.\u000a(iv) Price Risk Management is your call - its really just trading.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p334
aV\u000a\u000aLet's get some time tomorrow.\u000a\u000aEssentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  <NAME/> has decided that <NAME/> will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.\u000a\u000aLet's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too.\u000a
p335
aV\u000a\u000aAs you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.  As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in <NAME/> over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.  Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether <NAME/> intends to meet expense payments.\u000a
p336
aV\u000a\u000aCan you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately  (at their cost as it is late) whatever they can of the order.\u000a
p337
aV\u000a\u000aEES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThere is a potential that counterparties will allow us to promote a small group of individuals simultaneous to deal closure.

aV\u000a\u000aFirstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.\u000a\u000aAnyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each.\u000aIt works - we have enough people to do it.\u000a\u000aIn terms of the Estate:\u000aThe Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two <NAME/>Online environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for <NAME/> - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the <NAME/> estate.\u000a\u000aIn terms of NewCo:\u000aEnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.\u000a
p342
aV\u000a\u000aThe meeting has been confirmed.\u000a\u000aThey told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does I think differ slightly from integration.\u000a\u000aHave I missed any critical group?\u000a\u000a\u000a9 am 		Introduction\u000a9:15 am		Infrastructure 						Rub\u000a9:45am		IT - Development & Ops				Webb\u000a10:15 am 		Mid Office Start-up Overview				Hall	\u000a10:45		Credit Start-up Overview				Brackett\u000a11:15 noon		Accounting, cash etc Integration Overview		Colwell/Georges/Meyers\u000a\u000a11am 		Tour of the building/infrastructure			<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.\u000a\u000aWe also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high. \u000a\u000aPlease could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.

aV\u000a\u000aWhy can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. \u000aAlcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. \u000aNote: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aA.  <NAME/>Online has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of <NAME/>'s transactions are done via <NAME/>Online and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.    \u000a\u000aOur business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  \u000a\u000a1) Access new markets and customers\u000aIn addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, <NAME/>Online has enabled <NAME/> to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  \u000a\u000a2) Manage high volume of products and transactions\u000a<NAME/> does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before <NAME/>Online, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to <NAME/>Online and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to <NAME/>Online.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aTo paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to <NAME/>Online].  Because of the technology and software <NAME/>Online has developed, it is relatively easy for <NAME/> to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.\u000a \u000a3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line\u000a\u000a<NAME/>Online has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "<NAME/> is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [<NAME/>'s] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace <NAME/> launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. <NAME/>Online now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives. \u000a\u000a<NAME/> was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  \u000a\u000aForrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with <NAME/>Online dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  <NAME/> leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a	Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him <NAME/>.  He's a pretty good lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.  I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  <NAME/>'s brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July 1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty cool!  <NAME/> is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along. The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.  How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  "You and your faggoty white uniforms."  Just kiddin -\u000a\u000a						<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDoes the gas desk keep the demand charge?  Also, we need to discuss-if you forget tocall.   If you forget to call, the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated. Probably not a big deal in the summer but is a huge del in the winter with daily balancing.   Also, the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall.  If you forget tocall in the winter under daily balancing,  your desk will be charged my cost.   Otherwise, I think it's a go.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ano- the more the merrier.   Just need to get her phonenumber so we can hook her up..   By the way I talked on the QT to the Socal Gas trader and told him that I could not fathom that they would even consider 143 receipts points.  He said <NAME/> <NAME/> is clueless and currently is on a power trip.  They are going to meet with him next week to make sure that he understands that he works for them and not the other way around.\u000a

p569
aV\u000a\u000aII think you should just call her and tell her that you are an interested party in the proceeding and would like to attend.  Shw willnot have aproblem/\u000a
p570
aV\u000a\u000aI agree with your invitation list.  This is Deb's closest circle of friends and she would not want it to be any bigger.  I'm glad you included <NAME/> and <NAME/> becasue I was thinking about them today as well.\u000a
p571
aV\u000a\u000aThank you.  Just let me know if it changes.\u000a
p572
aV\u000a\u000aAttached are the key issues surrounding the El Paso case and ENA's position on each issue..  We currently are drafting comments based on our position which will be due at the FERC on October 14.  Such comments will support an immediate request by EPNG for turnback of capacity.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAs discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.  The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.  Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.  We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.  If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.  Thanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p578
aV\u000a\u000aYan,\u000a\u000aThe merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports:  \u000a\u000a31 Keystone Receipts\u000a15 Questar Pipeline\u000a40 Rockies Production\u000a22 West_2\u000a23 West_3\u000a25 CIG_WIC\u000a\u000aThe orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.\u000a
p579
aV\u000a\u000aJerry,\u000a\u000aI requested some questar flow historicals from you per the following email.  I am still in need of the referenced data, and would appreciate an indication of when it will be provided.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at the number below.  Thank you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Smith\u000a
p580
aV\u000a\u000aGood point.  Let's assign a D to it.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p581
aV\u000a\u000aMotorcross...white trashyness...sounds like fun.  i think i'm going to go home and pass out.  i'm so fucking tired.  went to the Dynegy bar last night and i think i had a few too many beers.  only thing is my roommates gone for the weekend so i'll probably get a little lonely.  oh well...i hope there's some good tv on.  sure wish i had some motorcross to attend!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p582
aV\u000a\u000aJody,\u000a\u000aI have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p583
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe last I left it with <NAME/> and <NAME/> W. was that I was going to compile a list of exactly what data we needed and I will include all the items you indicated.  I do have time this week, but not much because it's bid week.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p584
aV\u000a\u000aI'll be home Wednesday night and I fly out Monday afternoon, but I don't really know which days I'll be up at the 1000 islands.  Depending on when I go up to the 1000 islands, I'll probably come back from the 1000 islands on Sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking.  Would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for Sunday?  Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back.  <NAME/> will be around in case you didn't know.  Anyway, I'll be in touch.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p585
aV\u000a\u000aHey, I got an error back because the files were too big.  I'll stick them in the dropbox in a folder called scheadul.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p586
aV\u000a\u000aFYI, the portland website has a similar chart that allows you to double-click the bar and get the detail of the outages, as well as detail about the plant characteristics, so that you may be able to use some of their code.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYes, you should be able to pull the loads.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  there are several "scenario" runs of the model.  You should only use the "New Model" scenario which, I believe, is number 25.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000awell, people are in better spirits now that the deal is done.  Too bad there's still a bunch of uncertainty as to how we'll integrate the two companies.  at least i'm pretty sure that i will keep my job.  so now i just need to decide whether i want to keep it.  there's going to be some opportunities elsewhere as people leave <NAME/> and join other companies.  How's <NAME/> doing?  are they worried?  there probably aren't a ton of other trading shops in Portand.  At least there are a bunch of other shops in <NAME/> for people who get screwed from this deal...\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMo,\u000a\u000aHey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  <NAME/> to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.    \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p598
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSince I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.  Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.  Maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.  I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.  I'm available today to help any way I can.  Thanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe value should be 0 for R (the value moved from DRN 30685 which should have been changed to zero) and 30685 for D.  All the values were D's consistent with the existing data for DRN 30684 for those days prior to moving the R values over (which should be zeros for those days).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Anyway,  I'd like to give you  a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.  I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to <NAME/> again for a job with <NAME/>.  I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.  Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.  So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.  Any chance that anyone is going?  I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.  If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....\u000a\u000aWell, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> all is well.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLet's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated because of all of the turmoil at the company.  Weather was really nice, so <NAME/> and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.  Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.  At least there was plenty of beer.  Then we went home and grilled some steaks.  I like steak.  That's about it.  How about you?  Did you get all of your laundry done.  I didn't.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aPer our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aThe west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aSynthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aThis is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a<Embedded Microsoft Excel Worksheet>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI assumed we were scaping the "Inventory Chagne" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.  Can you check on this.  It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.  The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.  If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.  We're going to a martini bar before hand.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/\u000a\u000aSocal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline.  In their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the one or two locations for which <NAME/> has capacity allocations.  <NAME/> Gaskill indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flows for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (only 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Smith\u000a\u000a\u000aGerry,\u000a\u000aPer our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) quantities for Questar Pipeline meter points.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and I spent a few minutes on the phone with <NAME/> regarding the outage information we were trying to get.  With <NAME/>'s help and with the use of your stored procedure we saved a bunch of time.  Thanks for your help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p665
aV\u000a\u000aOh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's everything with you?\u000a
p666
aV\u000a\u000aPer our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.

And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San <NAME/> or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, <NAME/> can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a06/04/2001\u000aThe San <NAME/> Chronicle\u000a<NAME/>\u000aE.10\u000a(Copyright 2001)\u000a\u000aTHE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. \u000aOur enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.\u000aTake <NAME/>, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. \u000aAnd yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. \u000aWe have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. \u000aBut it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. \u000aVolunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. \u000aAND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. \u000aI'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. \u000aWe pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why <NAME/> Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. \u000aLook: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! \u000aWhy did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! \u000aI AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. \u000aWe are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to <NAME/> -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a> America:  The Good Neighbor.\u000a>\u000a> Widespread but only partial news coverage was given\u000a> recently to a remarkable\u000a> editorial broadcast from Toronto by <NAME/> Sinclair,\u000a> a Canadian television\u000a> commentator.  What follows is the full text of his\u000a> trenchant remarks as\u000a> printed in the Congressional Record:\u000a\u000a\u000a> "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the\u000a> Americans as the most\u000a> generous and possibly the least appreciated people\u000a> on all the earth.\u000a> Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and\u000a> Italy were lifted out of\u000a> the debris of war by the Americans who poured in\u000a> billions of dollars and\u000a> forgave other billions in debts.  None of these\u000a> countries is today paying\u000a> even the interest on its remaining debts to the\u000a> United States.\u000a> When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it\u000a> was the Americans who\u000a> propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted\u000a> and swindled on the\u000a> streets of Paris.\u000a> When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the\u000a> United States that hurries in\u000a> to help. This spring, 59 American communities were\u000a> flattened by tornadoes.\u000a> Nobody helped.\u000a> The <NAME/> Plan and the <NAME/> Policy pumped\u000a> billions of dollars into\u000a> discouraged countries.  Now newspapers in those\u000a> countries are writing about\u000a> the decadent, warmongering Americans.\u000a> I'd like to see just one of those countries that is\u000a> gloating over the\u000a> erosion of the United States dollar build its own\u000a> airplane.  Does any other\u000a> country in the world have a plane to equal the\u000a> Boeing Jumbo Jet, the\u000a> Lockheed Tri-Star, or the <NAME/> DC10?  If so, why\u000a> don't they fly them?\u000a> Why do all the International lines except Russia fly\u000a> American Planes?\u000a> Why does no other land on earth even consider\u000a> putting a man or woman on the\u000a> moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you\u000a> get radios.  You talk\u000a> about <NAME/> technocracy, and you get automobiles.\u000a> You talk about American\u000a> technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not\u000a> once, but several times -\u000a> and safely home again.\u000a> You talk about scandals, and the Americans put\u000a> theirs right in the store\u000a> window for everybody to look at.  Even their\u000a> draft-dodgers are not pursued\u000a> and hounded.  They are here on our streets, and most\u000a> of them, unless they\u000a> are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American\u000a> dollars from ma and pa at\u000a> home to spend here.\u000a> When the railways of France, Germany and <NAME/> were\u000a> breaking down through\u000a> age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.  When\u000a> the Pennsylvania Railroad\u000a> and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned\u000a> them an old caboose.\u000a> Both are still broke.\u000a> I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced\u000a> to the help of other\u000a> people in trouble.  Can you name me even one time\u000a> when someone else raced to\u000a> the Americans in trouble?  I don't think there was\u000a> outside help even during\u000a> the San <NAME/> earthquake.\u000a> Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one\u000a> Canadian who is damned tired\u000a> of hearing them get kicked around.  They will come\u000a> out of this thing with\u000a> their flag high.  And when they do, they are\u000a> entitled to thumb their nose at\u000a> the lands that are gloating over their present\u000a> troubles.  I hope Canada is\u000a> not one of those."\u000a> "Stand proud, America!"\u000a>\u000a\u000aThis is one of the best editorials that I have ever\u000a> read regarding the United States.  It is nice that one man realizes \u000ait.\u000a  I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it.  We are \u000aalways\u000a> blamed for everything, and never even get a thank you for the things \u000awe\u000ado.\u000a> I would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as \u000ayou can\u000a> and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends \u000auntil\u000a> this letter is sent to every person on the web.

p862
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.  I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.  \u000aThe traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.  Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.  \u000aThe west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?\u000a\u000aWe also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.  We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p863
aV\u000a\u000aThis was settled with <NAME/> <NAME/> last night. We have always reported our positions in contracts, they want to see it in BCF.  We will be reporting it that way going forward.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p864
aV\u000a\u000aGood question,\u000a\u000aI think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade.  What do you think?  \u000a  \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p865
aV\u000a\u000aCan they be done by Tuesday next week?  EOL needs these to get this information soon in order to start their set up process. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWe will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent <NAME/> earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.\u000a\u000aWe will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p870
aV\u000a\u000aI think I fixed the trailblazer path....the curve description on the curves tab didn't match the contract CB tab.  The ref# should go away once you roll it for today.  Try that this morning and let me know if it works.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p872
aV\u000a\u000aCan we also get the books that these used to be mapped to?  That will eliminate about 75% of the work.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOK, the fun continues.\u000a\u000aWe need to assign EOL products to traders.  <NAME/> sent a file (Netco\u005ccontrols\u005cTrader-Book template (US Gas)_EOL new books) with all products and the old book assignments.  We need to get with the traders today and get these split out.....many will stay the same as before.  \u000a\u000aAlso, when physical deals are done, will all risk types go to the same desk or will one person be managing the index separately.  ex. the west desk used to book all index to Grigsby's book.  I have told <NAME/> that all risk types will go to that trader's book but if index needs to be changed let me know.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p874
aV\u000a\u000aI don't know who has been saving these daily.  Can you tell whoever on the west desk to use the new file instead.  They are for the estate and need to keep them away from the Netco files.\u000a
p875
aV\u000a\u000aAs seen below,\u000a \u000aPlease start using the ENA DPR 0102 file rather than the EWS DPR 2002 file to send to <NAME/>.  The positions needed to be divided to reflect BCF's.  \u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000acould you also CC me the first few times you send it?\u000a

West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. \u000a\u000aI believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I will need this before lunch. \u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is the risktrac book entry template for these books. \u000a\u000a \u000aThis is the same info <NAME/> Valdes sent you, with a few extra details added.\u000a\u000a\u000a -----Origin [Keiser, Kam]   al Message-----\u000a
p948
aV\u000a\u000aI put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check with <NAME/> Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options books, there should be one book for both.  If you have questions about that can you please call <NAME/> McLaughlin directly?  Those are his books and I don't know how they need to be set up.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p949
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI put some question marks next to <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/>'s products.  You have them down as managing some physical products.  <NAME/> they be managing those physical books?\u000aIf not, they should go to the physical trader managing that location as before. \u000a\u000aCan you take a look at those? \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p950
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you check the contract on #500282.  The chicago office needed to add a month to this deal and it wouldn't let it due to the contract #.  I changed it but probably shouldn't have.  It probably needs a new ticket.  Let me know.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/> in Chicago needed this at 312-541-1235\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p951
aV\u000a\u000aI started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara.  I don't think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn't been around to get the demand charges either.  We should have everything clean to report it on Monday.\u000a\u000aGoing forward I guess we need to show people how to check it correctly.\u000a\u000aSee you on Monday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p952
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aPlease see the attached trader matrix template.  There were some changes made on the physical global id's.  <NAME/> South was also added on the west desk.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p953
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYes, my group will be the ones to book the demand charges in sitara.

p957
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Postlethwaite, <NAME/> Vinson and Casey Evans all have the title of Associate Director.  <NAME/> Reeves was a manager previously so I assume she is also an Associate Director.\u000a\u000aI will be out of the office the rest of this afternoon for a doctor's appointment.

aV\u000a\u000aCan you find out who in your HR would be a good contact for a job opening previously held by Lou Casari?  I have a friend at <NAME/>, my first boss, who will probably be leaving the company, but does not want to leave <NAME/> if she does not have to.  She is very well qualified for a management position, her resume should speak for itself.\u000a\u000aLet me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p959
aV\u000a\u000aJust a reminder to make sure you get <NAME/> a list of books/regions that are currently designated to be traded.  We need to change trader names etc. so make sure he gets us this information as soon as possible.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p960
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the file I started.  I know there is plenty of missing data because I did not know all the commodities involved with each counterparty.  If you could fill in what you know, that would be a big head start on this heinous project.  I will be out of the office tomorrow.  My cell phone works again so I will be available.\u000a\u000aHave a great weekend.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aNo, I just noticed that we hadn't had a staff meeting in a while and next week is month end and the next week I will not be here.

aV\u000a\u000aI have re-confirmed with Power Operations and there are no more spots available to make room for one more risk person.\u000a \u000aI have all of <NAME/>'s information and will be glad to communicate her offer to her, if it has not already been communicated.

aV\u000a\u000aWe will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by <NAME/> Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact <NAME/> Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe will be running a December MTD DPR tomorrow.  Before we start this process please recalc the East, West, Eastbank, & Westbank portfolios to AdHoc.  Check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the Bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the East and West portfolios.\u000a\u000aBefore kicking off the calcs, double check the specific deals that are listed on the Physical Power Terminated spreadsheet.  I believe there were whole deals moved to the Bank portfolios by <NAME/> that should never have been moved, because they were already liquidated in November.  Also, I have attached a new copy of the physical terminations.  There is one counterparty (TXU) added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs.  In addition to adjusting deal entry for TXU we also need to adjust scheduling.\u000a\u000aBefore recalcing the Bank portfolios, please contact <NAME/> Brackett or <NAME/> McGinnis (4-2022) to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios.\u000a\u000aWe should still be calcing on 'No True-up'.  Casey, I know you said this probably will still cause us trouble.  At this point, we are going for reasonableness with numbers.  All the previous top-levels in our rolls (as of the 3rd or 4th) will stay as top-levels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power.  The remaining prior day values will be held in Schedule E for Georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account.  These top levels should match the total value of your Bankruptcy portfolios.  Where I think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the Bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations.  These numbers will also have to moved to Schedule E.\u000a\u000aWhen running through liquidations in the East and West portfolios, we will not be flat.  Currently, we are liquidating all non-terminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling.  (Thresa and I are working on this with Corry and <NAME/>).  The settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the check-out and ultimately the clean-up process.\u000a\u000aTomorrow should be a blast - I can't wait!!!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p967
aV\u000a\u000aVlad,\u000a\u000aHere is the latest book list based on book requests.  The one item I know has not been requested is <NAME/> Zipper as the LT-Option trader.  When we request this and it is complete, we will send you an update.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p968
aV\u000a\u000aWasn't sure if you had heard anything about <NAME/> testing for EES and EnPower.  I am not sure there is anything we need to do, just wanted to keep you in the loop.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p969
aV\u000a\u000aCan you unarchive m:\u005ccommon\u005cpower\u005cposition\u005cdpr\u005c1999 and as far back as there are years in this directory.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p970
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> mentioned to me that legal wanted by delivery point and financial/physical broken out, so here is an update.  Numbers are still as of 10/18/2001.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p971
aV\u000a\u000aOne question:  I had <NAME/> <NAME/> put together the termination dates for each of the counterparties and was wondering if you could clarify something for me.  If a termination date is 12/4/2001, do I move 12/4 forward to the bankrupt book or do I move 12/5 forward to the bankrupt book?\u000a \u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p972
aV\u000a\u000aThank you regarding Min.  He does an extreme amount of work for us and I believe going forward we will need more rather than less of Excel type reports.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p973
aV\u000a\u000aI don't really like what they are suggesting either.  We'll talk Monday.  Besides, they(we) would have to get AA to sign off on half MTM half something else.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p974
aV\u000a\u000aI cannot view this request in eRequest.  Please approve on my behalf or remedy the problem of seeing the request and I will approve myself.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe bankruptcy post ids for 12-18 are 15296 and 15297.  The data should be available first thing in the morning.  <NAME/> is running the calcs for me because I was receiving error messages.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aIf the post ids change or the data is not available by morning please reply to all to let us know the status.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAre you currently preparing option sensitivity reports for <NAME/> Motley?  If so, please put together a bullet point list of what we do on a daily basis, who the audience is, and anything else you think might be relevant to an audience of users interested in what procedures we perform for stress/ scenario testing.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p977
aV\u000a\u000aCan you get with <NAME/> and show him what documentation we do have for Green Mountain?  Also, have you requested from <NAME/> Luong the documentation we sent them for Green Mountain's Schedule C.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p978
aV\u000a\u000aCan you have someone do this?  I forgot to put it on the group's To Do list for the week.  (Besides, I thought I would do it myself, but never seem to find time).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p979
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThis file gives you similar information to the file that <NAME/> sent you for gas.  <NAME/> is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model.  If you want me to change anything, let me know.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCost Center 103823 should have 6% allocated to West Power (not 13%) and 94% allocated to East Power.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p981
aV\u000a\u000aWe have many deals in the system with UI, but they are all part of one contract.  To my knowledge, this is the only big contract we have with them.  Just wanted to let you know because going through all the deals would be time consuming and they basically are one huge deal.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p982
aV\u000a\u000aPlease forward to the following:\u000a<NAME/> Hiemstra\u000a<NAME/> Baughman\u000aNaveed <NAME/>\u000a\u000aThe request is for the East and West portfolios (non-terminated).  <NAME/>'t forget to include Capacity and show separately in queries. By Portfolio, by Counterparty, by Category Code - P&L and delta by month.\u000a\u000aAlso send a P&L update to <NAME/> Sager and <NAME/> Miller.  The original files are 'East by Counterparty' and 'West by Counterparty'.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p983
aV\u000a\u000aWhen you get around to setting up these fields for the West, please use the portfolio code 'W' for West and then use the same methodology for Book Code that <NAME/> did.  I'll let you know the answer she gets from <NAME/> re: 'US Power East' because you should be using 'US Power West'.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p984
aV\u000a\u000aCasey,\u000a\u000aCan you have someone follow up with Hai and <NAME/> and see how all these reports are working?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p985
aV\u000a\u000aI have already updated the Physical and Financial Terminated spreadsheets with these updates.  Please have your groups start the split/clean-up scheduling process for the new counterparties.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p986
aV\u000a\u000aCasey and <NAME/> can get back to you on your specific question re: Canada.  However, I wanted to let you know that our DPR will more than likely not be final until Friday.  Hopefully we can get you all reports then.  We have had to leave the DPR open due to many terminations that are still funneling our way and we are getting the 12-31 data as clean as possible for the estate.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p987
aV\u000a\u000aHave them go through accounting.  This is non-trading expenses.  Not our area unless it runs through the DPR.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p988
aV\u000a\u000aThe orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSince we talked about a lot of different spreadsheets, can you give me some more guidance on what was included in the spreadsheet I talked about so I will send you the correct one.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p991
aV\u000a\u000aJust wanted you to be aware of our concerns regarding Min Zheng.  He is our Excel support and is called upon on a daily basis for help.  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p992
aV\u000a\u000aI am waiting for an answer back from <NAME/>, but was wondering if you or any of your contacts might know the answer to the following.\u000a \u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p993
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.\u000a\u000aPlease provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThought you were moving this meeting to 3:00.  <NAME/> and I have a meeting with UBS from 1:00-2:30.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p995
aV\u000a\u000aNo formal agenda has been planned for our staff meeting today.  Instead, I would like for each of you to think of a question(s) or problem(s) that you have encountered while in the group.  These questions/problems can be something that you already know the answer to or have yet to receive the answer.  For those areas that you already know the answer, this would be a good time to share what you have been working on with the rest of the group and maybe stop everyone else from running into the same question/problem.  For those areas that you do not the answer, we will do our best to get that answered.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, if there is any additional detail that you would like to know regarding topics covered in the Risk Overview class, this would be a good time to ask since the class is fresh on your minds.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> & Casey\u000a
p996
aV\u000a\u000aCasey,\u000a\u000aCan you please auto-schedule the following deals for December.  Please let <NAME/> and I know when you are complete.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aDeal #\u000a114998\u000a578961\u000a578964\u000a578965\u000a
p997
aV\u000a\u000aAfter talking to <NAME/> I have a new plan of attack for Schedule E's.  He informed me that the top-levels were typically put in at one region level per roll.  I had Zhiyun re-run the killed deals calc (post id 15667).  Everyone should go back into the rolls and put the top-levels into their correct regions also adjusting the Schedule E's.  This is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots.\u000a\u000aI have also identified where the $4.6 MM difference for OPPD arose from.  Deal # 11678.04 has not been transferred into the East Bank book.  In addition, there are no volumes in this deals; however, if you look back to the official 11/30/2001 calc there are volumes for this deal.  It gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for OPPD (11678.4, and 564826.1).  Deal 564826.1 was transferred but the valuations are approximately $4MM different.  I have printed detail for deals 11678.4 and 564826.1 (they are in Casey's chair) as of the 11/30/2001 official calc.  I have also printed deal 564826.1 in the 11/30/2001 bankruptcy calc.  I noticed that I cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc.  Please re-calc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details.\u000a\u000aOther than <NAME/> who has to perform some IT testing, no one should be working (or playing) on anything other than trying to get these Schedule E's and top-levels figured out.  The task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe power curves are actually located in M:\u005cpower2\u005cregion  If you want access to this drive please resubmit request and make sure it is Read Only.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p1000
aV\u000a\u000aI certainly do not anticipate that we will.  I hope the Estate people are designating someone for this.  I am going to look into it.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1001
aV\u000a\u000aGood News!!!  The termination spreadsheets have been updated.  There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial.  <NAME/> Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward.  It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates.  Please look at this so we can use it on our updates.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1002
aV\u000a\u000aAlso, will you get <NAME/> to give direction on what traders will be allowed to trade what regions.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1003
aV\u000a\u000aThis is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the DPR.  <NAME/> Buy, our chief risk officer, asked that we get back to normal as soon as possible.  I am currently working on termination statuses and when deals will be killed etc.  I am also working on a way to get the PCS cleaned up.  Continue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more confusion than it is worth.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1004
aV\u000a\u000aLooks good - you mention month-end deadlines.  You also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading P&L.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1005
aV\u000a\u000aNow that <NAME/> has been cleaning out scheduling tables, will you ensure that the prepays in the document below are still in the scheduling system.  If they are not, we can autoschedule them.  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1006
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you find out if this Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement covers all our deals with TXU?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1007
aV\u000a\u000aFYI  - we will be running a live simulation on Thursday.  I will give you more details when I know something.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aWhen you get a chance will you ask <NAME/> if he is aware of this?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1008
aV\u000a\u000aLet's wait until we all meet so we don't piecemeal the data to you, but you are correct in your assumption about transmission for the East.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1009

aV\u000a\u000aSounds like a great idea to do follow-up reviews.  \u000a\u000aI have budgeted $2000 a month for travel and lodging on the West RC.  I would prefer you keep it to every six weeks in order to cover me coming up there and others coming down for training.  I think it would be beneficial for you to be able to meet with groups in <NAME/>.  I also only budgeted for $100/month for Overtime/Working Meals so we may have to subsidize that with the traveling budget.\u000a\u000aI have not heard anything lately on the video conferencing.

aV\u000a\u000aCorry,\u000a\u000aI would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system.  We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower.  There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great.  I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we, along with Unify users, will come up with a plan.  I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well, let me know your thoughts.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is my request:\u000a\u000aCan you make the system calculate a killed deal?  There were deals killed with Sempra Energy Trading on Saturday and the credit group needs to know what the value would have been had these deals been calculated against yesterday's curves.

Then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below.  As of tonight, please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow.  Also, remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day, so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions.  These amounts should also be top-leveled.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Currently, we are extremely busy trying to close out old business at the same time as setting up details of the new business.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and I are both well, probably working too hard.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> this helps a little bit re: RisktRAC.  After talking to <NAME/>, I believe the key to book codes is ensuring from IT that we can use whatever we want as the database will be entry.  <NAME/>, I agree that you should keep a power list and Kam should keep the gas list.  Also, just wondering if when we set up the gas books should we have also put in requests for gas daily, basis, index, etc.  I couldn't remember how that worked.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe blending vs. non-blending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so I would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as I understand them.  \u000a\u000a	Only the curves applicable to the East NERC regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility; therefore, no blending is needed for daily options (they point directly to the daily vols) or monthly options (they point directly to the monthly vol).  All curves applicable to the West NERC regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly; therefore, blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options.\u000a\u000a	The best rules to be in place for the blending vs. non-blending would be based on curve.  East curves do not blend.  West curves do blend.  Therefore, ANY daily or monthly option in the East would not have to blend.  The potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that, for example, the East portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a West region (curve) and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the East portfolio.\u000a\u000a	Options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem.  Are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration?  We still need to discuss this.\u000a\u000a	I would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules.  Let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCall me tomorrow so we can discuss the following:\u000a\u000aEmployee morale\u000aTerminations with cash already paid\u000aOther terminations to ensure they are not affecting downstream systems\u000aScheduling cuts\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1076
aV\u000a\u000aI hope all is well with you!  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I will be arriving in London Saturday, November 3.  We will be there through the next Saturday, leaving early that morning.  Can't wait to see you.  Any exciting news?  How's work, social life, etc.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1077
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aHere are the procedures for the East.  The West is not currently running option sensitivities. \u000a\u000aApproximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using PortCalc.  Three parameters are tested:  Price (increments from -5 to +5), monthly Volatility (increments from -25% to +25%), and Time (increments up to 90 days.  (Reminder:  the increments are changeable)  The data is imported from PortCalc into an Excel pivot table.  The pivot table is then used to show how the various Greeks (delta, gamma, theta and Vega) change for each trader's book, generally with a 3 month look ahead.  The data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria, if requested, such as by region and delivery date These reports are given to the East option traders only.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1078
aV\u000a\u000aI am sorry to be difficult and you can definitely have a meeting without me and fill me in later, but the all-employee meeting is today and I have been asked to be there by <NAME/>.  In addition, I have a work lunch headed by <NAME/> to discuss the all-employee meeting.\u000a\u000aSorry again,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1079
aV\u000a\u000aI know of nothing in stage that I use.  I would like to make sure Casey and <NAME/> both agree with me.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1080
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is a spreadsheet with marks as of 12/18/2001.  If you need anything else, please let me know.\u000a
p1081
aV\u000a\u000aSounds good to me.  FYI - the option true-up was a different issue, related to the way options were being input into the system.  They had days which would fall out of the calc, not a last day of the month problem.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1082
aV\u000a\u000aI just heard a rumor that the Ercot Power Trading was going to sit in the Gas (Open) section.  Is this the case and does it change the seating for gas and power risk?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1083
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is the file.  I am planning on continuing to look for the $30.5 MM that is created when you add dailies and compare to YTD.  (Cell M245).  You can delete these information if you want.  Remove December from the reconciliation because I only gave them data through 11/30 and Curve Shift data for December is completely useless.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1084
aV\u000a\u000aPower December books are final.  This does not mean that every termination has been accounted for in the final Dec. 31 calculation.  We eventually hit a stopping point for terminations and will catch up the remainder of terminations in 'after December' books.\u000a\u000aAlso, power books are set up as you have defined below.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1085
aV\u000a\u000aEach of you needs to send a book request for the East & West portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts.  Please create a East-Performance and a West-Performance book.  We then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books.  I would suggest you pull the values out of AdHoc as of 12/31 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk.  Obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the P&L in the old and new books and flatten out.  The remaining prior day value will need to be in Schedule E.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I'll try to keep you up to date with any changes.

Issues 1-3 are correct and complete, but 4 & 5 are not. \u000aI imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone. \u000a\u000aWhile we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type \u000afor basis options.\u000a

I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aPS  I haven't been able to close any deals with <NAME/>, but I feel that I am very close!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSo, if I have made payment under this plan will these new CD's I've ordered be free even though they have initially been accessed a charge?

She made a comment about you yesterday, your name came up and she said "that <NAME/>."  I said "I thought you and <NAME/> were friends."  And she said "Oh that <NAME/>!"  So I figure she's mad at you for, you know the "twins."  Anyway I won't say anything, so don't worry.  We moved the happy hour to next Friday 26th, so you better be there.\u000aMaybe even "Cool <NAME/>."  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHello you guys,\u000a \u000aWell I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!  You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.  Anyway I hope you're doing fine.  I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.  I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.  The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.  The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.  There are people flying in from all over the country.  Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.  It's a big pain but obliviously needed.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Go UT!\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000aPS  We haven't found a place in Vail, but we are still looking!\u000a

p1402
aV\u000a\u000aHey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!   I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.  I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.  But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.\u000a\u000aThanks Again\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000aPS  At dinner, see if you can seat me next to <NAME/>, I'll owe you!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aYeah, actually we are throwing a happy hour tonight.  You should meet us for drinks.  I'm going to lunch now, so I'll talk to you later.\u000a
p1406
aV\u000a\u000aDo you want to go to dinner sometime?  Maybe I'll have you up to the house where I can do some REAL cooking!\u000a
p1407
aV\u000a\u000aI have attached my resume.  I had to use one of the other guys emails because I was having some problems with my system.  Look forward to seeing you on Thursday.\u000a
p1408
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI haven't been involved in these final rounds of contact changes so please get with <NAME/> so we can get this contact out the door.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1409
aV\u000a\u000aThis is a Gas Daily call deal.  The deal is still alive and underway.  The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.  Please get with <NAME/> <NAME/> on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1410
aV\u000a\u000aPlease look this deal over throughly as we are getting very close to closing with these guys.  I will be giving both of you a call this morning to answer and final questions you may have.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1411
aV\u000a\u000aHere is some more bullshit from CIG.  I wish they could get these tie-ins going!  I'll be out of the office Wednesday returning Friday late morning.  I'll be calling you but if you need me call me on my cell (303) 810-5708.  Tell <NAME/> "Broncos all the way!"\u000a
p1412
aV\u000a\u000aThe latest at <NAME/> is Business as usual.  At least that's what they want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.  Hopefully they send some of these <NAME/> directors to jail!\u000a\u000aNothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the <NAME/> Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!\u000a
p1413
aV\u000a\u000aWhen I first saw the picture I did think it had a chance of being real, until everyone else said it was a knock off.  I was a little puzzled as to how anyone found the camera.  So at least I had my doubts.  So you want to stay in Calgary another year?\u000a
p1414
aV\u000a\u000aDo you want to meet for lunch Wednesday?  Then spend the night, or at least until you have to leave?  WE can hot tub!\u000a
p1415
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/> needs to only talk to me.  And, what color are you wearing?  I would hold on <NAME/> stock for now.  I think it is a long term buy but I don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so I think you may get a better price if you wait.  Are you wearing Jeans tonight.\u000a
p1416
aV\u000a\u000aI briefed <NAME/>, +8 into WIC & +1 CIG Wind, both at the mid.  I'm thinking about the 2000 A8, they start in the low 50's.  I think I'll take out a loan and secure it with <NAME/> stock and stock options!\u000a
p1417
aV\u000a\u000aWhat time should I meet you at your house on Saturday?  I'm not going to the reception tonight.  Shoot me back directions to your house.\u000a
p1418
aV\u000a\u000aMy mom is having a party.  She has this party every year, the average age of the party goers is about 60.  At least I can get drunk on my mom nickel.\u000a
p1419
aV\u000a\u000aHello,\u000a\u000aI'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in <NAME/> this weekend.  \u000a\u000aAs far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion, do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.  \u000a\u000aAnd finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing you!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1420
aV\u000a\u000aCall me later tonight at home.  I kinda busy today and I want to get out of here early.  I'll talk to <NAME/> about your start date.  Are you bored?\u000a
p1421
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWow you are really bringing me down!  No I don't feel uncomfortable giving you my information.  I do want you to know that you have always been a pleasure to work with and I hope we can continue working together in the future.  If you get some time off, hopefully time off with pay, come to <NAME/> and I'll take you skiing!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Lucci\u000a4761 Yates CT\u000aBroomfield, CO 80020\u000acell (303) 810-5708\u000aHm (303) 469-6768\u000aemail  I need to get it fixed, I've been receiving everything here at work.\u000a
p1422
aV\u000a\u000aThe existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.\u000a
p1423
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere are the picks for week 4:\u000a\u000a\u000aJoey Brewer - Miami\u000a<NAME/> "going all the way" Lucci - New York (Giants)\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is the proposal we had discussed today.  Please look it over and I will contact you early next week to discuss it further.\u000a\u000aThanks again\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1426
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the latest on our search for a new condo.  Search Over!  Due to the recent drastic fall in the <NAME/> stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.  So we will have to look for a place to stay.  Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.  We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.   I'll start looking for leads on housing.  I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.  Keep me posted on everything.\u000a
p1427
aV\u000a\u000aWhat is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of <NAME/> blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers \u000aare coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from <NAME/> so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask <NAME/> about the naked pictures I've got.\u000a\u000aLater for now\u000aThe Looch\u000a
p1428
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThis is a revised copy from <NAME/>.  Please disregard the last copy and review this one.  I'll call you to make sure you get it.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1429
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is saying that your the top candidate for this position.  No matter what I say I can't change his mind.  Man I can hardly wait!!!!!!\u000a
p1430
aV\u000a\u000aI will call her.  I need to give my hair about two weeks to grow out.  Has she started to date again.  I thought she had given up on men after her divorce?  When are you going to get your hair cut?  I've got a date with <NAME/> this week, well at least I think I do.  Have you talked to <NAME/> about Friday?\u000a
p1431
aV\u000a\u000aWe ARE working!  But we don't know if we are getting paid.  We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.  But after that who knows?  They are laying off over 80% in <NAME/>.  We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.  \u000a \u000aWhat did you do this weekend?  Did you go out with your "friend" JP?\u000a
p1432
aV\u000a\u000aI'm looking forward to it also.  I may not do the ski training class tonight, I'm worried about my ankle.  So, if I don't I'll be ready around 6:30.  I'll keep you posted.  Let's talk later.\u000a
p1433
aV\u000a\u000aThe deal was done with Field Services and we should change our deal ticket "counter party" to reflect that.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1434
aV\u000a\u000aNow wait a minute I think your getting in too deep here.  I have always or at least have reserved the right to see other people.  So, don't freak out!  Or I'll spank you!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1435
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aCan you please get with <NAME/> Cogan on our need for all wire transfer backup.  We will need the detail of all wire transfers sent to ENA for payment on the CIG and PSCo assets.  You can reach me at 303 575-6474.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p1437
aV\u000a\u000aThat party on Saturday night sounds fun.  I've got plans Friday but nothing on Saturday.  Is this the friend that was dating all those guys while she is married?\u000a
p1438
aV\u000a\u000aAs you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/<NAME/> merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  \u000a\u000aI feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you <NAME/>, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new." \u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGood morning, I do feel better today.  I think being outside yesterday brought out the worst in my cough.  Good luck in your talks!\u000a
p1442
aV\u000a\u000aYou are not bothering me and I will tell you if you are.  Your right I don't like to gab on the phone for long periods of time, but I like talking to you. I like to keep everything short and sweet. So, tell me when I'm going to see you again.  You will miss the big Limo party on Saturday.  Too bad the car is full.  And, even with a bad ankle I can still dance.\u000a
p1443
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aPlease look this purchase proposal over and forward it on to the applicable parties.  This proposal is completely open for negotiations, you can reach me at (303) 575-6474 to discuss this proposal further.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSincerely,\u000a<NAME/> Lucci\u000a

p1445
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as <NAME/> <NAME/> is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.  We are currently trying to do these sort of Index deals for the winter and one year time periods.  Anything after that is anyone's guess.  If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.  <NAME/> all is well, and watch out for CU!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p1448
aV\u000a\u000aI have a customer in town Thursday night, so we will be taking him out to dinner, than to the Nuggets game.  I still want, and I'm planning, to go to the concert on Friday night, so don't count me out.  We will have to do dinner some other time.  Make sure we talk on Friday because I have an open house from 3:00 to 6:00, and I'll start drinking and forget the plans.  How is everything else going.  I had a GREAT time on Saturday night, so I hope you did also.\u000a\u000a[Lucci, <NAME/> T.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aI guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack.  I have to admit that i wasn't looking forward to it since i didn't know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy.  About 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool.  She kept asking are you o.k. and almost seemed to sympathize with me.  She said she didn't say anything to dax and would never say anything to him.  She was so cool about it i was totally shocked.  So on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them.  I walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised.    After we had been there for a while Z, laura, devon, and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table.  So starts saying so you aren't going to email me anymore and acting all sad.  Then she said i didn't have any balls.  Later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the anti-heisman and motions as if to open her legs.  It was funny as shit.  She also said she dumped dale but i don't know that i completely buy that.  Anyway, all together it was very interesting weekend.  I don't know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous.\u000a
p1452
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> said he is getting a big group of people to go to renaissance festival nov 3 - which i know is when coon ass et all is coming in town so thought that might be something fun to do for everyone (although $20 is kinda steep).\u000a
p1453
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.  They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check for the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the <NAME/> from <NAME/>.\u000a
p1454
aV\u000a\u000aI called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 9.95.  After 6 months, the rate goes to 12.95 - they charged us for hbo, showtime, and cinemax which should be 16.95 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we don't currently get cinemax.  I went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package (with cinemax) and they are crediting us for 19.95 for the overcharge.  Going forward the package will be 16.95 or we can cancel cinemax and save 4.00 a month.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an American Drew bedroom furniture set.  At the time, I was purchasing the furniture from a company in North <NAME/> after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores.  We had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and I would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands.  After several unexpected delays, I have canceled my order and received a full refund from the North <NAME/> company.  If you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before, I would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately.  I am sure you are busy, however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me, I would like to discuss purchasing the furniture.

"I got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz. Y'all real niggaz out there, you know who you are. Y'all was there for me, and it's about time I'm-a give some love back to God's true crew."\u000a\u000a      "All y'all niggaz, y'all be My niggaz," the Lord added.\u000a\u000a      As of press time, God has thanked nearly 7,000 of His niggaz, including those in New York's Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders posses, the No Limit soldiers and Cash Money Millionaires holdin' it down in New Orleans, Nelly and the whole St. Lunatics crew, Busta and the rest of the Flipmode Squad, His peeps from back in the day, and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown. He also sent shout-outs to everybody in the Old School, as well as to Lil' Bow Wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up.\u000a\u000a      "Mad props to P. Diddy, <NAME/>-Z, DMX, Lil' <NAME/>, Mystikal, <NAME/>, Ja Rule, Jadakiss, Trick Daddy, and Xzibit. And one love to Meth, RZA, GZA, Ghostface, and the rest of My real niggaz in the Wu-Tang Clan," the deity said. "These My beloved niggaz, with whom I be well-pleased."\u000a\u000a      Now nearing the 48-hour mark, the Lord's first-ever reciprocal shout-out shows little sign of slowing down. Based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked Him in liner notes over the past 20 years, hip-hop experts say the historic shout-out is likely to continue through early next week.\u000a\u000a      In addition to rap's current stars, God offered shout-outs to the original hip-hop heads, including such pioneers of the art form as Grandmaster Flash, Busy Bee, <NAME/>le <NAME/>, Jazzy <NAME/>, Kool Moe Dee, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Red Alert, the Cold Crush Brothers, Fab 5 <NAME/>, <NAME/> Blow, Kool Herc, and the Funky 4+1.\u000a\u000a      God also offered shout-outs to the many DJs, record labels, magazines, TV shows, and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hip-hop over the years. Among them are Def Jam, <NAME/> Boy, Jive, Roc-A-Fella, Rap Pages, The Source, Right On!, The Box, Funkmaster Flex, <NAME/> Lover and Dr. Dre, WBLS 107.5, KISS-FM, and Hot 97.\u000a\u000a      "For supporting the many artists who have supported Me so faithfully, I say thank you," God said. "All praise to <NAME/> Harrell, <NAME/> Simmons, LaShell <NAME/>, and everybody else at Uptown/MCA for making this possible."\u000a\u000a  <http://graphics.theonion.com/pics_3731/god_gives_shout_out_jump.jpg>	 	\u000aAbove: A pair of shout-out tablets handed down by the Lord. 	\u000a\u000a      As a further sign of His love for the hip-hop community, God assured the nation's rappers that He is taking good care of all their peers currently with Him in heaven.\u000a\u000a      "Tupac, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, <NAME/> LaRock-some of y'all niggaz are already up in this bitch," the Lord said. "For those of you who were left behind, know that the Lord has got your dead homies' backs. <NAME/> [Evans], I promise I'm taking real good care of your Biggie. He resting in crazy peace, no doubt."\u000a\u000a      Thus far, God has not played favorites, thanking such fallen-off acts as Hammer and Vanilla Ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong. The Lord has also seen fit to thank the little-known likes of Baby Tragic, DJ Phreek <NAME/>, and Da Ill Collector-MCs so obscure that virtually no one within the hip-hop community has heard of them. All rappers, God explained, are equal in His sight, and none are too small to escape His notice.\u000a\u000a      "God sees even the smallest sparrow fall," said Dr. <NAME/> West, Harvard University professor of African-American studies and philosophy of religion. "The same is true of MCs: Whether a major superstar or a complete unknown, all rappers are His children, and He loves them all."\u000a\u000a      The sheer volume of names notwithstanding, the nation's rappers are deeply touched by God's gesture of tribute and appreciation, with many stating that they "feelin' Him."\u000a\u000a      "God is the Original," <NAME/>-based rapper Mos Def said. "The world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked, but all respect due to the Creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike."\u000a\u000a      Despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers, the Lord is drawing fire in certain circles for His use of the word "nigga." On Monday's <NAME/> <NAME/> Live, conservative activist Rev. <NAME/> Butts, a longtime ally of the Lord, blasted Him for His "shocking, unexpected use of the racially loaded N-word." Some concerned parties, including decency crusader C. <NAME/> <NAME/>, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and members of the San <NAME/>-based What About The Children? Foundation, are calling for a boycott of church services until God issues an apology.\u000a\u000a      Reacting to the controversy, many in the hip-hop community are rushing to the Lord's defense.\u000a\u000a      "The word 'nigga' means different things depending on how it's used and who's saying it," rap legend and Public Enemy frontman <NAME/> D said. "Judging from context, God obviously wasn't being derogatory. He was using 'nigga' as a blanket term of affection for all His true supporters on the rap scene. At one point, He said, 'I wanna give a shout-out to Ad-<NAME/>, MC Serch, and my man <NAME/> The Automator-all y'all is real niggaz in My all-benevolent sight.' Considering the fact that Ad-<NAME/> and Serch are Jewish, and the Automator is Asian-American, it's clear God isn't talking about race here. He's just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to Him."\u000a\u000a      "God's the ultimate playa, so naturally He's going to have some haters," rapper Ice Cube said. "But these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs, you will get your ass smote.

aV\u000a\u000aI am not sure if <NAME/>'s Food Service department manages the Starbucks but you do I would like to report a continuous problem.  Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThere is a very good website for getting information regarding current events - www.drudgereport.com  I highly recommend you read it if you want to get the "real scoop" about what is going on in the World Trade Center bombings.  As to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that Osama Bin Laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind and/or financier.  If you are interested -  read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible.\u000aOsama Bin Laden is a terrorist that has targeted American people before (embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on USS <NAME/> in Yemen earlier this year) and it would be in America's best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life!\u000a-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aU.S. focuses on Bin Laden links with Hizbullah, Arafat's Fatah \u000a \u000aSPECIAL TO WORLD TRIBUNE.COM\u000aFriday, September 14, 2001\u000aWASHINGTON - The United States is investigating whether a coalition of Palestinian, Iranian and Lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in New York and Washington.\u000a\u000aU.S. defense sources said the Pentagon and CIA are quickly coming to the conclusion that Saudi billionaire fugitive Osama Bin Laden was the sponsor of the attack. But they said Bin Laden is believed to have used a range of Islamic groups for logistics and support.\u000a\u000aThe groups being investigated include the Fatah movement headed by Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, the sources said. Another group being examined for a link to the U.S. attacks is the Iranian-backed Hizbullah, Middle East Newsline reports.\u000a\u000a"Most of it today points to Osama Bin Laden," Sen. <NAME/> Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said. "But the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with Hizbullah, Fatah and other."\u000a\u000aGrassley was one of at least two dozen House and Senate members who were briefed by U.S. intelligence agencies since the bombing.\u000a\u000aA U.S. official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that Bin Laden was provided aid by a range of Arab and Islamic groups. But the official said no determination has been made.\u000a\u000a"We want to be sure we understand all the connections, not just one connection," the official said. "As we find out who actually perpetrated the crime, as we find out who they're connected with, as we find out who could be considered harboring them, I think it'll come clear."\u000a\u000aAnalysts and some congressional sources said the Bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of Iraq in the U.S. attacks. They said that the administration fears that targeting Iraq would dash hopes for an Arab coalition against terrorism in the Middle East.\u000a\u000aDefense Secretary <NAME/> Rumsfeld said the United States has not yet determined who was behind the bombing. Rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon.\u000a\u000aThe administration has requested $20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign. Defense Secretary <NAME/> Wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack.\u000a\u000a"I don't think we know the breakdown yet, partly because the needs are so enormous," Wolfowitz said. "A significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness."\u000a

Each team will start with 100 fantasy points to use for bidding on free agents and will be awarded points each week based on your finish that week.  The highest scoring team will receive 1 point and the lowest scoring team will receive 10 points.  Each Thursday at 12pm we will conduct a free agent draft.  You must submit a list of the players you want to bid on with the points you bid on them to an email address yet to be determined.  After 12pm the highest bidder for each player will we awarded the free agent.  You can bid 0 points for a player but will lose if anyone else bids at least 1 point.  \u000a\u000aIf you have a Defense or Kicker on a bye week, you can pick up a bye week replacement from the free agent pool for free.  After the bye week is over, you must drop the replacement player.  Bye week replacements must be submitted via email to mcuilla@enron.com and will be awarded based on lowest YTD points scored.\u000a

Oh well!\u000a \u000aIf it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?\u000a \u000aAlso, <NAME/> is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (<NAME/> promises that he will definitely be there).\u000a
p1495
aV\u000a\u000aI have heard back from <NAME/> and he wants us to cancel the event.  Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo  any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling.\u000a

Nov 3.  \u000a\u000aYour family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from <NAME/>.   I'll give you better directions later.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.

Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news.  I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend.  What would you think about tryin to coordinate hair appointments Sat?  My only constraint is <NAME/>'s noon soccer game.  If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?\u000a

I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.\u000a\u000a Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-<NAME/> ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the <NAME/> intranet or servers are down?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.\u000a\u000a2.

Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.\u000a\u000a4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aWhen you get in tomorrow, could you please check whether the direct flight on the 15th cleared.  If not, please advise which flight path I'm currently cleared on.  \u000a \u000aI don't want to lose the return home through Moscow on the 31st (waitlisted also for 29th or 30th); but I may also need to return immediately after my court date from Almaty on Dec 23 (in such case my husband would fly back to Moscow to pick up our daughter after the 1st of the year).   I would like to make such a reservation is possible.\u000a \u000aI think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me.\u000a \u000aPlease call me when you get a chance.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.  \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aMy notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions\u000a- where storage allocation notices appear \u000a- why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.\u000a\u000aFixes already put in place\u000aIn the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:\u000a\u000a- Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls\u000a- Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings\u000a- <NAME/>'t we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime\u000a- We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages\u000a- Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators\u000a- Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ}\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'm not sure if we met either time at the <NAME/> airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old <NAME/>, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring <NAME/> home -- the sooner, the better.\u000a\u000aBased on conversations with <NAME/> and <NAME/>, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.\u000a\u000aWe have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to <NAME/>); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.\u000a\u000aOne of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  <NAME/> speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from <NAME/>, the escort that came to <NAME/> with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aSorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Corman (husband <NAME/> Erb)\u000a14126 Scarborough Fair\u000a<NAME/> TX 77077\u000a\u000ascorman@enron.com (work)\u000acormanerb@cs.com (home)\u000a\u000a713-853-7083 (work)\u000a281-531-0385 (home)\u000a713-857-2103 (cell)\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAre you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 4 tickets (est. cost $10,000)?  Would need to be split 10 ways to be doable?\u000a
p1523
aV\u000a\u000aI'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  <NAME/>'t worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).\u000a \u000aWe received our INS approval to adopt <NAME/>, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk <NAME/> into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute.\u000a
p1524
aV\u000a\u000aOops my mistake.  I've lost track of my dates & was thinking that Winefest was several weeks off.  Its next week!\u000a
p1525
aV\u000a\u000aI know you are swamped with other matters, so I jotted down in memo form my travel plans.  I guess it's <NAME/>'s Law that I got the phone call that I need to travel now in the midst of current work events.\u000a
p1526
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'll have to do this by phone with you.  <NAME/> is sick.  <NAME/> stayed home this AM, but I'm planning to work from home this afternoon.\u000a
p1527
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI never heard back from you after I sent the fax yesterday.  I am anxious about correctly signing and notarizing the INS forms and would like to discuss when you have a minute.\u000a
p1528
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was about to send off the info from the prior email when I received your latest update.  However, I'm confused by the update.  The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.  Is that really where we are sending our registration information?  What about the autobiography.  What is that, What is required?  \u000a\u000aI understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.  But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.  Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.  I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.  When to apply for SS#.  What about readoption.  Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc.  I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.\u000a\u000aI need to take care of the registration issue today, as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week.\u000a
p1529
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aFYI.  The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations.\u000a
p1530
aV\u000a\u000aOkay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.    \u000a\u000aI am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for <NAME/> at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.\u000a\u000aBased on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  <NAME/> will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to <NAME/> & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave <NAME/> to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that <NAME/> is still scared o <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi.  I'm here -- just barely though -- my sinus infection is back.  Can we get together in my office (the less elevator riding the better) sometime between 11-1?  I'm planning to be out of office tomorrow.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi Mom,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> just loves his apple checkboard.  Thanks again for it.\u000a\u000aI am still feeling sick.  Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny.  I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something.\u000a\u000aI'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.  Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list.  It seems kind of rude and presumptious.  However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. <NAME/> is into -- I thought I'd provide this list:\u000a\u000aThings <NAME/> Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20)\u000a\u000a-<NAME/> Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows)  (more expensive item)\u000a-Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows)\u000a-<NAME/> Potter Trading Cards\u000a-Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs"\u000a-<NAME/> Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item)\u000a-Ultra Grip Nerf Football\u000a\u000aIncidentally, <NAME/> is asking Santa for the <NAME/> Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.\u000a\u000a\u000aMore Later\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWould you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for Nature Explorer Camp July 29-Aug 2.  The Audubon lady said that I can sign <NAME/> up with the 7-8's if he's going to be with a 7-year old buddy.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Schedule\u000aI'm not planning any camps for <NAME/> the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).  \u000a\u000aJune 10-14 is <NAME/> VBS\u000a\u000aWe'll be on vacation week of July 1-7\u000a\u000aAshford VBS July 22-26\u000a\u000aHopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.\u000a\u000a\u000aI'd like to sign him up Biron's or some other camp 1 or more weeks (either):\u000aJune 24-28\u000aJuly 8-12\u000aJuly 15-19\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aJackie,\u000a\u000aI got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next Thursday, Dec. 13.  I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.  I think I've misplaced her email address.  If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.  Thanks and have a blessed holiday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1536
aV\u000a\u000aI would like an updated copy of the schedule you brought me with adescription from the reps about why the customer is saying that they haven't paid.  Especially Peoples.  On first glance it looks like many of the items relate to capacity release or Peoples.\u000a
p1537
aV\u000a\u000aJoceyln,\u000a\u000aI've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the <NAME/> check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.\u000a\u000aUnless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith <NAME/> and put the caption FBO <NAME/> Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1538
aV\u000a\u000aI know you were being nice and I am sorry.\u000a\u000aI really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  \u000a\u000aI shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  \u000a\u000aThe heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.\u000a\u000aMy physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics. \u000a\u000aAm I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?\u000a
p1539
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust a heads up -- pending pipeline board rep approval, <NAME/> asked that I prepare the attached letter for <NAME/> Somerhalder to send to the GISB office if this is appropriate form.\u000a
p1540
aV\u000a\u000aI'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.  I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.  But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & <NAME/> have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.\u000a
p1541
aV\u000a\u000aCan they come in the afternoon on Feb 18 (President's Day)?  I have an appointment with the tax lady in the AM.\u000a\u000aCan you see about getting <NAME/> a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM  (or at 1 PM) ?  Is it time for <NAME/> to have an appointment again?  <NAME/> has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.  <NAME/> has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.  We may go to the zoo after that.\u000a
p1542
aV\u000a\u000aYes,  I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year.  I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat. morning at plant at the church.  If you want to meet me there around 8:30 AM or so that would be great (but please don't feel obligated).  I think we could get the planting done in about an hour.\u000a\u000aCongrats to you on your recent wedding.  I am so thrilled for you both.\u000a
p1543
aV\u000a\u000aI am feeling pretty blue today with all the <NAME/> stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on <NAME/> Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses.\u000a
p1544
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your leadership on this issue.  The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.  I'm glad you are involved!\u000a\u000aI will be traveling out of the country next week.  Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.\u000a\u000aHappy Holidays\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1545
aV\u000a\u000aThank you for your thoughts.  I am fine.   Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally.  While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many <NAME/> employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.  It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there!\u000a
p1546
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for talking to Ange.  I'll give her a call tonight.\u000a\u000aMy preference is for me to take 3/17; you to take 3/24 (I'll have company); and no children's church on <NAME/>.  Let me know what you think.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1547
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aDo you know how to get in touch with <NAME/> <NAME/> or <NAME/> Fancler over the weekend?\u000aI have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for TW for the bankruptcy lawyers -- including contract lists and receivables.  I need to have someone run a payables list.\u000a \u000aI can be reach via blackberry or on cell 713-857-2103\u000a
p1548
aV\u000a\u000aWhen I asked you to adjust the Gas Logistic's PAA's to $100, I forgot to ask you to do the same on the separate PAA for gift checks for EOTT pipeline control.  Please give me a call if you need any supplemental paperwork from me.\u000a\u000aHappy Holidays\u000a
p1549
aV\u000a\u000aI was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my concerns about missing <NAME/>'s Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday issue.\u000aMy gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.  Because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time.\u000a
p1550
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.  The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price.\u000a
p1551
aV\u000a\u000aHere is my draft written review.  Take a look at it and we'll sit down when you have a chance.\u000a\u000aKeep up the great work.  I know things have been really stressful for you lately.  It was terrific to have you to rely on when I was away (and when I'm here too!)\u000a
p1552
aV\u000a\u000aSounds interesting (although I don't have capital dollars at this point for modifications to make CAS accessible to customers).   Let me touch base with my team to talk about this concept & I'll get back with you.\u000a
p1553
aV\u000a\u000aI think we expected it.  The ALJ said he need more time for his decision.  On a positive note, it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement\u000a
p1554
aV\u000a\u000aI know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  \u000a\u000a- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence\u000a- When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters\u000a- And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.\u000a\u000aI wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.\u000a
p1555
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is having a 1/2 day staff meeting next Wed.  Dec 12 until lunchtime.   Accordingly, I need to reschedule my staff meeting.\u000aPlease let me know about your availability to meet from 1-3 PM on Dec. 12 in my office.\u000a
p1556
aV\u000a\u000aI was referring to the fact that Bearpaw is an actual marketing affiliate of NNG and is posted as such on the website.  Bearpaw has a transport contract on NNG.\u000a
p1557
aV\u000a\u000aMr. <NAME/> is sick today with a 102 fever.  <NAME/> stayed home this AM, but I have to relieve him and work from home this PM...so I need to reschedule lunch.  I really need to talk to you though.  Could you go for coffee or a quick dinner this evening on your way home assuming <NAME/> is headed to Kingwood?\u000a
p1558
aV\u000a\u000aSorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number. \u000a\u000aIn the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.  So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth.\u000a
p1559
aV\u000a\u000aYes.  Please add <NAME/> Head, <NAME/> Bakanic & <NAME/> <NAME/> Syckle if its not too many.\u000a\u000aThe offer is still open for you and <NAME/> to host at my house if you would like.\u000a\u000aHere is Gaby's address:\u000a                    Leader #937\u000a<NAME/>, TX 77072\u000a
p1560
aV\u000a\u000aOkay - so I see that it's <NAME/> Cogen (not Orange).  I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso.  Do they own 100% of <NAME/> Cogen?  Are they the designee?  Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract?\u000a
p1561
aV\u000a\u000aI would like these individuals to have a training with Teb Lokey today or tomorrow.    Teb is aware of my desire in this regard and is awaiting your call to set up the time.\u000a
p1562
aV\u000a\u000aI love Aigerim and visited with her on my recent trip to Taraz.  I took lots of pictures of Aigerim and\u000aif you send me your mailing address I'll send them.  I am very interested in Aigerim's placement.  Let me know either way about your decision.  If you decide not to adopt her I would love to continue to advocate for her.\u000a
p1563
aV\u000a\u000aGot your note.  I'm volunteering at school this afternoon and can't open the attachment on my Blackberry.  I'll review and send you a note over the weekend\u000a
p1564
aV\u000a\u000aCall me when you get to the office.  I have been thinking of you constantly this last week and am anxious to hear your voice.\u000a\u000aHave a great week back at the office.\u000a
p1565
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/> & <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.\u000a\u000aGroup's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think "Bug's Life").  The bible lessons are about <NAME/> and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.  The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume <NAME/> Turney made.  I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).   I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.  I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.\u000a\u000aI also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.  I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.  Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.  \u000a\u000aEvening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (<NAME/> will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri. Feb 8  - if either of those days suit.\u000a
p1566
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>\u000a\u000aI have <NAME/> at the Dr for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening.  Sorry I missed choir last night .  We are still transitioning and <NAME/> had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir.  \u000a\u000aSee you soon\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1567
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - Right after I had <NAME/> run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, <NAME/> called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp.   \u000a\u000aDo you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHere is the missing language\u000a\u000a\u000aSTATE OF TEXAS  \u000aCOUNTY OF HARRIS\u000a\u000aSworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMy conversation with <NAME/> was quite different than my conversation with <NAME/>.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at <NAME/>tmas.\u000a\u000aOn my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.\u000a\u000a\u000aYou can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.\u000a
p1568
aV\u000a\u000aBoth <NAME/>'s parents & my mom will be at the house on Christmas eve/Christmas day -- so I think they'll eat their Christmas meal at our house.  I'm sure that <NAME/>, <NAME/>, Mom and Nevin would appreciate a Christmas evening dessert invite.  You can coordinate when you see them for Mexican food on Sat. night.\u000a\u000aHave fun at the violin concert.\u000a
p1569
aV\u000a\u000aFirst worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to <NAME/> <NAME/>.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).\u000a
p1570
aV\u000a\u000aI just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.\u000a\u000aThe final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:\u000a\u000a1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.\u000a\u000a2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.\u000a\u000aCommissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  \u000a\u000aThe discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.\u000a
p1571
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aI would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.\u000a \u000aWith respect to the specific project listed:\u000a \u000a1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.\u000a \u000a \u000aWith respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:\u000a \u000a2.  Dynegy requested and <NAME/> agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes <NAME/> to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that <NAME/> is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.\u000a \u000a3.  Dynegy requested and <NAME/> agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  \u000a \u000a \u000aAn additional footnote should be added to the page.\u000a \u000a4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and <NAME/> will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.\u000a
p1572
aV\u000a\u000aSorry I missed you today.\u000a\u000aLooking forward to lunch tomorrow.  <NAME/> 11:45 at La Grilia suit you?\u000a\u000aHave fun at your event tonight.\u000a\u000aAlso - mea culpa.  I just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that I missed <NAME/>'s birthday.  I hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house.  Oops.  Wish <NAME/> a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion.\u000a\u000aSee you tomorrow.\u000a
p1573
aV\u000a\u000aI don't understand why the schedule show no variance for Gas Logistics.  My workpapers indicate that we should be down by $300K or so\u000a
p1574
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.  All of my paperwork (including INS approval) is turned into <NAME/> and I am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.  <NAME/> and crew are so busy that I imagine that things won't happen very fast.  \u000a\u000aNot try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1575
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI spoke with <NAME/> today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because <NAME/> is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.   \u000a\u000aThis journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  \u000a\u000aI was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1576
aV\u000a\u000aCan you send me the latest version?\u000a\u000aAlso, I am expecting to shortly have the power plant numbers to add for the 1 market and 1 southend power plant per year based on actual annualized revenues from a recent market power plan (Great <NAME/>) and southend (PowerTex).\u000a
p1577
aV\u000a\u000aHi Ms. Traylor,\u000a\u000aI gave my mom a heads up that "flat <NAME/>" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like\u000arecent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor <NAME/> is needlessly tossed on fears of biological\u000aterrorism could you confirm whether Master <NAME/> might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's\u000aemail.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy <NAME/> is with school.  At first he expected to be \u000acoddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.\u000aYesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.\u000a\u000aI really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what <NAME/> needs to develop.\u000a\u000aWhile I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted\u000aa 4-year old orphan girl (<NAME/>) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, <NAME/> was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look\u000alike <NAME/> and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, <NAME/> may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Corman  (<NAME/>'s Mom)\u000ascorman@enron.com\u000a

As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index\u000aprice for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a\u000acash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the\u000aweeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following\u000amonth.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of\u000aimbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above\u000a5%.\u000aHowever,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all\u000aimbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level\u000afrom 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this\u000atier of imbalance.\u000a\u000aTexas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed\u000ato Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.\u000a\u000aAny person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the\u000aFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,\u000aD.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and\u000aRegulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section\u000a154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.

aV\u000a\u000aHere is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.\u000a

Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.  Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance).\u000aIowa:\u000a?	Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.   Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.\u000a\u000aWisconsin/Chicago:\u000a?	With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.   To some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized, as Wisconsin Gas has already bypassed Northern via Great Lakes.    The distance of competing pipelines to many Northern towns will preclude bypass for many others.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> competitors in the market area include:\u000a?	Alliance\u000a?

We have been trying to keep <NAME/>'s routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.\u000a\u000aDo you have any suggestions to help <NAME/> with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?

aV\u000a\u000aHere's my first stab\u000a\u000a\u000aKey Findings\u000a1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.  The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close\u000a2.  The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through\u000a3.  There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.  Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF.\u000a4.  The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations  (Gas Logistics).\u000a2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters.\u000a3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close.\u000a4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI worked on the grade level promtion.  I didn't know what her new title was supposed to be. <NAME/> chcecked with <NAME/> and she told her coordinator.  So I guess we'll have to check back in with <NAME/>\u000a
p1597
aV\u000a\u000aSkyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is my two cents...\u000a\u000aFrom your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches \u000aoverhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  \u000a\u000aThe condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on\u000aour property or destroy the tree.  \u000a\u000aA landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is\u000aobstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since\u000athe condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue.\u000aFurther, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm \u000aunless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  \u000a\u000aIf the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.\u000a\u000aBottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.\u000a

But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.\u000a- Going to do fly over.\u000a- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard.

aV\u000a\u000aI thought that you would enjoy reading this article about <NAME/>'s school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.\u000a\u000aAWESOME VISIT\u000aOn Friday, October 19, President <NAME/> H. W. Bush and <NAME/> Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!\u000aThe day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!\u000aAs the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.\u000a<NAME/> Strange, <NAME/> Liu, <NAME/> Siso and <NAME/> Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. <NAME/> Reese, <NAME/> Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from <NAME/>'s class) , and <NAME/> <NAME/> wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWhen I called <NAME/>'s house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at <NAME/>' house -- so I guess that means <NAME/> has returned.

I am very concerned that we will slip to <NAME/>tmas time travel.\u000a\u000aWhile I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at <NAME/> or <NAME/> this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.\u000a
p1620
aV\u000a\u000aOkay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.\u000a
p1621
aV\u000a\u000aI already had <NAME/> prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations.  It is rough still -- but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe.\u000a
p1622
aV\u000a\u000aIt's been canceled.  There were no unauthorized withdrawals.  It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances.  It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features.  The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features.\u000a
p1623
aV\u000a\u000aSorry I'm so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion.  Nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy.  Before I left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers -- per <NAME/>'s note below the bankruptcy court hasn't acted on it yet.  I'll let you know if I hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1624
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aTypically I sign all these EDI trading partner agreements with Lee Huber's initials.  Can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that I can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the GISB standard agreement.  We can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard TPAs?\u000a
p1625
aV\u000a\u000aDid ETS officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment?  Any computers or just flat screens?\u000a
p1626
aV\u000a\u000aI have been friends with <NAME/> Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  <NAME/> is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, <NAME/> Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with <NAME/> and <NAME/> as a couple since that time.  Both <NAME/> and <NAME/> are loving parents to their six-year old son <NAME/>.  It has been a delight to watch them raise <NAME/> to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Nicolay\u000a{contact info}\u000a\u000a\u000aPlease call <NAME/> Garcia to pick it up when done.  Thanks -- I'll call you tonight\u000a
p1627
aV\u000a\u000aI think it sounds worthwhile -- since <NAME/> Breathitt and Stacy Girard are participating.  If <NAME/> is unavailable, I think <NAME/> Lowry or <NAME/> <NAME/> would also be great choices.\u000a
p1628
aV\u000a\u000aI can make that work for <NAME/> if that is when Drew is available.  I assume you are talking about Wk of June 24?\u000a
p1629
aV\u000a\u000aOh my perhaps I've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of <NAME/>'s rock collection.  It consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum.  He would love anything about rocks.\u000a
p1630
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/> & <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.\u000a\u000aWhen I spoke with <NAME/> a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.  \u000a\u000aAfter I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.  \u000aI am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?\u000a\u000aI would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in <NAME/>. \u000a\u000aSorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.\u000a
p1631
aV\u000a\u000aI guess we'll cancel the direct report meeting since this means that <NAME/>, <NAME/> & <NAME/> will be absent.\u000a
p1632
aV\u000a\u000aCan you please advise what is going on with the flat panels that we had planned to distribute to our gas logistics team.  It was in the budget and we had the okay, but now I'm hearing there is some hold-up & the units are stored on 44.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1633
aV\u000a\u000aMy thought is that the <NAME/> contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.  I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.\u000a
p1634
aV\u000a\u000aGreat.  Just wanted to make sure I was on the right wave length -- as <NAME/> <NAME/> has asked the IT folks for more detail on the contracts and revenue projects and I didn't want to lead the IT folks astray with my understanding of our meeting if it was incorrect.\u000a
p1635
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aThanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday <NAME/> took <NAME/> <NAME/>, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and <NAME/> Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and <NAME/> Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).\u000a \u000aToday, <NAME/> <NAME/> of FPL and <NAME/> Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with <NAME/> <NAME/> and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at <NAME/>'s where hopefully <NAME/> and <NAME/> will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.\u000a \u000aEarly this AM I'll be out speaking at <NAME/>'s Ops conference.\u000a \u000aI'm going to call <NAME/> to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements.\u000a
p1636
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>/<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe Orphans petitions coordinator at the <NAME/> INS office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon.  She said that we should receive the approval notification form within a week.\u000a
p1637
aV\u000a\u000aNo thank you for all you and your teammates do. \u000a\u000a I get a bit frustrated when <NAME/> says that "we all need to  re-focused back to work.  I need to remind him that we have never lost our focus, that despite what has been going on, our staff has continued to work 24/7 to maintain our service level to our customers.\u000a
p1638
aV\u000a\u000aIf you don't know about the NNG quality posting that's probably a good sign that it hasn't been posted yet.  I'm hoping to have a conversation with <NAME/> <NAME/> tomorrow before its posted. Thanks.  Get back to your kid stuff now!\u000a
p1639
aV\u000a\u000aThe FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.\u000a\u000aThere are three main principles behind the current rules:\u000a1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate\u000a2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and\u000a3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.\u000a\u000aThere is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.\u000a\u000aSo, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.\u000a
p1640
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aI've never received any feedback on my notes.  Can you give me some direction on whether my assumptions are correct?\u000a
p1641
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> this morning.  She received my dossier and is sending it for translation.  She said she will be at <NAME/> Ivins today reviewing dossiers.  She also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be "apostilled" in <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aI asked <NAME/> to send you the picture of Oksana.  She said that she thought she had already had.  She said she left you a voice message & would try to call you again later.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon.\u000a
p1642
aV\u000a\u000aNo, we live about 2-3 mi. off I-10.  It is really easy to get to our house from <NAME/> by taking 71 to I-10 east. \u000a\u000a\u000aHere is a turn by turn:\u000a\u000aExit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown <NAME/>).  \u000a\u000aGo South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).  Take right onto Briarforest Drive.  Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).  We live on Scarborough Fair -- third street off Briarhome.  Our home is 2-story red brick & is in the NE corner.\u000a\u000a14126 Scarborough Fair\u000a<NAME/> TX 77077\u000a281-531-0385\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso last night I emailed Sergei a brief note regarding what <NAME/> was telling us yesterday. I didn't want to jump ranks or push him for an earlier date -- but I wanted to make certain that he knew that all our paperwork is in.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI'm fine with not having Children's Church Palm Sunday -- recognizing that we won't have CC for 3 weeks then.  I'll adjust the curriculum notes accordingly and we'll pick up with Children's Church on April 14.\u000a
p1645
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAttached are the written comments that I prepared while I was traveling.  Let me know when you would like to sit down and talk both about 2001 and directions for 2002.\u000a
p1646
aV\u000a\u000aI'm back.  I was gone all of two minutes.  I needed a bathroom break.  I figured out that the straw was simply the 2 or 3 issue and so I didn't bother to chime in when I returned.\u000a
p1647
aV\u000a\u000aCan you please check whether the 401K withdrawal was received on your end.  It looks like it left my account.\u000a\u000aAlso can you tell whether the check in from Bank One cleared?  It doesn't look like its in the account either.\u000a
p1648
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aThe dial in network is down so <NAME/> is headed into the office to get the PGE capacity release report.  It may be an hour.  Sorry for the delay.\u000a
p1649
aV\u000a\u000aDoes that mean <NAME/> will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old <NAME/> badge for the full week.\u000a
p1650
aV\u000a\u000aIn the past we have blessed RAC as a truly corporate function with whom we could share information and receive services.  When I read that there are power trading folks on the RAC team, my radar goes up about the need to put firewalls in place within RAC.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both <NAME/> Operations Services Co & <NAME/> Corp. in 2001?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI have another meeting at 3.  I'll join you late if I can.  I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.\u000a\u000aThis morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/<NAME/> the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us.\u000a
p1657
aV\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a\u000aSaturday was great.  Yesterday was not a banner day for me.  I just kept having feelings of remorse and then guilt that I was feeling remorse.  You're probably the only person that can understand how I'm feeling.  Talk to you tonight.  If you and <NAME/> are gone to Karate before we get home -- we'll go to the store and have dinner ready.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWhen I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with <NAME/> Higginbotham).

What is your team working on on Gulfstream?\u000a\u000aAlso can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.

aV\u000a\u000aCorp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some \u000asteps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  \u000a\u000a1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities\u000a	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.\u000a	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.\u000a\u000a	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South\u000a	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard\u000a	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. \u000a\u000a	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and\u000a	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.\u000a\u000a	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation\u000a	Center (EB42C1). \u000a\u000a2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone \u000a	\u000a	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared \u000a	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. \u000a	\u000aOn Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics\u000abusiness functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, \u000aand workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to\u000asupport the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured\u000afor approximately two weeks, depending on events.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSorry I missed your call last night.  I had a good cry and went to bed early.  \u000a \u000aAs you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).  \u000a \u000aHere is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.\u000a \u000aI am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting <NAME/> a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.  That way <NAME/> can return for <NAME/> after the first of the year if necessary.  Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.  I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with <NAME/> there.  Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.  \u000a \u000aI am totally terrified about traveling by myself  -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.\u000a \u000aI need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  <NAME/> the assistance service help me at customs?  <NAME/> Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?\u000a \u000aObviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without <NAME/>.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.\u000a
p1665
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI also wanted to mention that I confirmed the Connie <NAME/> of Travel Brokers received our passports and Kazakstan and Russian visa applications and is holding them pending instructions from you.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSchedulers talking points on the separation of NNG/ENA\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.\u000a\u000a2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.\u000a\u000a3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.\u000a\u000a4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi,\u000a\u000aSorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  <NAME/> had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is <NAME/> home from school - so he and <NAME/> could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with <NAME/> or the kids anytime this weekend.\u000a\u000aTwo other items when you get a chance:\u000a-Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date.\u000a-Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at <NAME/>.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> all is well.  Talk to you soon.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1674
aV\u000a\u000aWith heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:\u000a\u000a1. When I parked in the <NAME/> Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the <NAME/> building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.\u000a\u000a2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....\u000a
p1675
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aExcept for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.\u000a
p1676
aV\u000a\u000aHow did you make sure it was the right set?  <NAME/> it be delivered?\u000a\u000aI,m so excited.  This will make my week.\u000a
p1677
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aPlease call ASAP.  While I have been working through the theory on how to make this happen, but I don't know the details on which pipelines and which accounts.\u000a
p1678
aV\u000a\u000aHi.\u000a\u000aSorry we missed rehearsal Sunday, but we are definitely still "transitioning." \u000a\u000aWe will be out of town on Sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing.  We will be at choir practice Sunday evening.\u000a\u000aI'll look for March and April songs for the Cherubs.\u000a\u000aThe videotape of the Christmas program is cute.  Maybe we can find a time to watch it.\u000a
p1679
aV\u000a\u000aI'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  <NAME/> - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  \u000a\u000aIf these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.\u000a
p1680
aV\u000a\u000aI'll have someone pull the volumes in the morning if its not too late.  Sorry but my messages didn't come across my blackberry when I was in <NAME/> Fri & Sat.\u000a
p1681
aV\u000a\u000aDid <NAME/> give you any read on how long to translate our documents or when they might be sent to Kazakhstan?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1682
aV\u000a\u000aFYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.\u000a\u000aI really enjoyed our talk last night.  You gave me some really good advice.  \u000a\u000aI'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.  I think <NAME/> would love the water rafting.  We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon.  <NAME/> really, really wants to have <NAME/> come over to play soon!\u000a
p1683
aV\u000a\u000aI think your outlined measures sound fine.  I would think we could change to the new hotline almost immediately.\u000a
p1684
aV\u000a\u000aDates all work great.  As you mentioned, I will likely be traveling in late November or early December\u000a
p1685
aV\u000a\u000aYes I am here actually I'm on a conference call.  I'll email later tonight.  <NAME/> will be out of the country on Feb 9.  I'm hoping I can bring <NAME/> and make a play date for <NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000aWe are headed to <NAME/> tomorrow.\u000a\u000aWe'll be back Sun.  Can you meet at T and C on Sun afternoon <NAME/> would like to go to Zainy Brainy and I need to exchange some things at Gymboree\u000a
p1686
aV\u000a\u000aYou don't need to keep the attachment.  I was going to read it online -- but since you've printed I'll take it along for casual reading.   I just want to add <NAME/> Gras email address to my contacts.  Sorry for the confusion.\u000a
p1687
aV\u000a\u000aRicki - I don't yet have answers back to many of the questions that I pitched to HR and <NAME/> and <NAME/> are out -- so could you see about the possibility of moving our staff meeting to tomorrow afternoon?\u000a
p1688
aV\u000a\u000aPressure to finish my review! My husband is in Indonesia on business, so don't be surprised if I reply in the middle of the night when kids are asleep and I can concentrate\u000a
p1689
aV\u000a\u000aStill working...for today anyway. We spent a cold weekend in Conroe TX.  <NAME/> was well-behaved all weekend.  \u000a\u000aCan you do lunch this week?  Perhaps tomorrow?\u000a
p1690
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>/<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on <NAME/>'s spreadsheet.\u000a\u000a\u000aA couple of further things that I need:\u000a- I need to reconcile the net volume on <NAME/>'s sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on <NAME/>'s sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?\u000a\u000a<NAME/> for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.\u000a\u000a\u000aLet me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.\u000a
p1691
aV\u000a\u000aMr. <NAME/> is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.\u000a\u000aI'll have my cell phone with me too.  We will be back on Fri. Mar 15.\u000a\u000aPlease look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion:  April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.\u000a\u000aFYI - <NAME/> had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.  She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.\u000a\u000aI've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility).\u000a
p1692
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  I went to see Dr.  <NAME/> Leeds Rickets this am.She is a Baylor grad and is very nice.\u000a\u000aGlad you weren't in an accident today.  Have a good trip.\u000a
p1693
aV\u000a\u000aPlease call.  I'm confused about the hotel amount.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - we will hand out the prizes in a raffle on the date of our holiday luncheon on Dec. 11.\u000a
p1694
aV\u000a\u000aGreat <NAME/>,\u000a \u000aI'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party.  You are the best.\u000a \u000aMy sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too.  We're going to be out shopping that day.\u000a
p1695
aV\u000a\u000aA couple of thoughts\u000a\u000a-  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between <NAME/>-Frankfurt-<NAME/> Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take\u000aTransaero one way from <NAME/> ata to Moscow.\u000a\u000a- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.\u000a\u000a- I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.\u000a
p1696
aV\u000a\u000aSomewhere convenient to <NAME/> since he has to come from Beltway/EOTT.  <NAME/> he come down Wetheimer?  If so we can meet at Highland Village - Grotto is it?  Or if he comes down I-10n then ??\u000a

(lp1699
V\u000a\u000aThat is understood.    He will be taking Glisan's position which had the same restrictions on it.    I don't plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions.   There would be no purpose in giving him E&F data. \u000a\u000aBy the wya, <NAME/> needs to do the Marketing Affiliate stuff.\u000a
p1700
aV\u000a\u000aThis message was sent earlier today to the finance/accounting/operational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow.  Your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time.\u000a
p1701
aV\u000a\u000aWhy do our numbers look so high in the 4th quarter and then fall off so much?     We have to get a better handle on all of this and fast.\u000a
p1702
aV\u000a\u000aI am getting ready to announce that I am bringing <NAME/> <NAME/> into EGS as Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have <NAME/> working with Corp on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willing to carve out some priorities.\u000a
p1703
aV\u000a\u000aAren't you being a little rough on her on a problem that really doesn't make any difference to Dynegy?\u000a
p1704
aV\u000a\u000aYes.  They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.\u000a
p1705
aV\u000a\u000aI will submit that that may be the case today.  I am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form 2 (regulatory) will require.\u000a
p1706
aV\u000a\u000aWE are following the issue and I believe INGAA is going to be filing somethiong that we have had input on.\u000a
p1707
aV\u000a\u000aOn the other deal, they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars.  I will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for <NAME/> tomorrow.\u000a
p1708
aV\u000a\u000aNot at this time.   I think as long as <NAME/> is performing, I'm not sure why there is all of this noise.\u000a
p1709
aV\u000a\u000aThis position is truly needed in Omaha to provide support as <NAME/> suggests.    I only wish there was a way to move someone from here to there.\u000a
p1710
aV\u000a\u000aCAn you 2 help her out here?    I believe the footnotes probably cover it, but to the extent you have more, it would be helpful.\u000a
p1711
aV\u000a\u000aYou might say that we are lending the Money to <NAME/> and therefore are now looking further than nng and tw\u000a
p1712
aV\u000a\u000aI have asked and will let you know the answer later today.    The bigger question is that they can not loan money to <NAME/> and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.   More update later.\u000a
p1713
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:   Can you help me figure out who I need to talk to to get the deals we did with you as ECT back in 1999, modified?\u000a
p1714
aV\u000a\u000aI think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.   It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither <NAME/>, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended.\u000a
p1715
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to but we may have to put it off until next week.    I am currently working weird hours trying to get the $1B of debt closed and funded.   I will get back to you.\u000a
p1716
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>: \u000aWhere do I go inside <NAME/> to get straight what it is that I need to do in order to be able to use the curves I am told that we need to be using?\u000a
p1717
aV\u000a\u000aI think what the partnership values it does not have to have a relationship to what we value it at.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>?\u000a
p1718
aV\u000a\u000aMaybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.   I am little touchy right now about how to approach people, so we need to be careful.   I am open to more discussion on this, just would like to soften the tone a litlle.\u000a
p1719
aV\u000a\u000aI am not sure, I just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of.\u000a
p1720
aV\u000a\u000aPlease send tomy direct reports.\u000a\u000aWhile I am out of the officetoday please keep <NAME/> <NAME/> up to speed on what you see and hear.  He is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stress/crisis for me.\u000a
p1721
aV\u000a\u000aIf I needed to change the account that bills were to be paid into for this necxt billing cycle can it be done, for TW and NNG.\u000a
p1722
aV\u000a\u000aSince we are no longer using Maverix, that guarantee can be done away with.    Are the rest all really with <NAME/>?    In the underlying deals do we have any ability to ask for better than a guarantee if enron is downgraded?\u000a
p1723
aV\u000a\u000aI am assuming that by now you know that I am pledging my receivables into the secured deal <NAME/> Boyle is working on.\u000a
p1724
aV\u000a\u000aThey took bids and I think have an offer of about $60 MM or so.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>: What do you know about this one?\u000a
p1725
aV\u000a\u000aThe data is actually aggregated and netted, the specific deal data is not provided.   The detail he described might be the aggregate of 40 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals.   See the bolded data below.   The example given basically says I am in a position of having more gas at Ventura in January 2002\u000athan I have commitments to sell by 10 MMCF/d.     Did you understand that?\u000a
p1726
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> called back and explained.    We need to do 100% and begin to look at dollars that could be saved.    This is an estimating process to figure out if we can effectively reduce our spending and by how much and then what portion of that benefits <NAME/>.\u000a
p1727
aV\u000a\u000awe will get it handled.     CAn you send out the notice that the dates are changing and we will have to reschedule before you leave?\u000a
p1728
aV\u000a\u000aI think that we are already well underway on TW's red rock and were not expexting to use external capital for.  No other major projects underway. That are impacted by enron's situation.\u000a
p1729
aV\u000a\u000aI have asked Corporate where it will be reported in the 4th qtr, if it's not going to be reported as wholesale then there is no real reason to bother <NAME/>.\u000a
p1730
aV\u000a\u000aTo the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c\u000a\u000aDrew: Can you think of anything we may have done while you were in Omaha that might fit this request?\u000a
p1731
aV\u000a\u000aI have forwarded to <NAME/> and agree with your perspective.    Could you begin to think about who those people might be if we decided to do something?\u000a
p1732
aV\u000a\u000aThe following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and <NAME/> Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:\u000a\u000aThe funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to <NAME/> will carry <NAME/> Corp guaranties.\u000aThe note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.\u000aThe credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and <NAME/> and the rest of it's subsidiaries.\u000a\u000aBefore the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between <NAME/> and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.\u000a
p1733
aV\u000a\u000aStill want to try and get it done this year. Per <NAME/> this am. Cash is king for now and we need thepricing to get the rest of the cash.   If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be.\u000a
p1734
aV\u000a\u000aI am leaving the lake.  Use cell for next 40 minutes and then use home if you need me.  Remember blackberry doesn't work so well at home\u000a
p1735
aV\u000a\u000aNo, he is in fact commercial doing deals negotiating transactions of significant size, 2.5 B this year alone.\u000a
p1736
aV\u000a\u000aTracy and jim are trying to track down 6 more copies. Could you see where this stands? We are in 49c1\u000a
p1737
aV\u000a\u000aWe have done it before, in fact it was the way all of the pipes were originally built, but not for short term stuff.    <NAME/> Russo can probably help us with his property tax background.   Lou, please try to get hold of <NAME/> or whomever he believes should take part in the discussion.\u000a
p1738
aV\u000a\u000aKyle:\u000a\u000aPlease find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. <NAME/> data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the "Database" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions and I will attempt to get you through them.    I can also get you set up to get even more detailed answers if you would like.   \u000a\u000a                                                 \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks for the email.

p1740

aV\u000a\u000aThe meeting will at the most last a little more than an hour or 2.    Nothing special to prepare for.\u000a
p1747
aV\u000a\u000aTalk to <NAME/>, but I think he is working on a reliability issue that probably needs to handled, but may be able to be done over a period instead of all at once.   I really don't know, but he will.\u000a
p1748
aV\u000a\u000aThis is very confidential at this point in time.   Do not forward.     Be prepared to discuss the job that each does and what we need to do to be able to transition early monday am if not before.    Call me.   This is what I am trying to reach you about.    The assumed time frame for this is next week.\u000a\u000aMy numbers are as follows:\u000atry this one first:    936-597-3905\u000aor my cell: 	713-201-6135\u000a\u000aHappy Thanksgiving,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI believe at this point in time I can support this request.    I also believe that <NAME/> does not have the capacity currently to absorb.\u000a
p1750
aV\u000a\u000aI am going to begin discussions with the banks as soon as we get the Phase 5 financing locked down.     I would expect that we could have it in another month, unless I run into some kind of a buzz-saw out there, and I'll let you know as soon as I do.\u000a
p1751
aV\u000a\u000aAll spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.	I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.   This is a directive I have just received from <NAME/>.\u000a
p1752
aV\u000a\u000aI was actually thinking only about the people in <NAME/>'s Brassfield's crew?  But he should now about already, as he supports <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWhere do you stand on this stuff now?\u000a\u000aFor everyone, if we are going to get this done, we need things taken care of.    If there is a problem you need to let us know ASAP!\u000a
p1755
aV\u000a\u000aI would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.\u000a
p1756
aV\u000a\u000aThat would work well if I was trying to do projects, but I am trying to be able to utilize the curves in the business to measure VaR.    We now use them for NNG & TW in the Caminus System, and want to do so for our other pipes as well.\u000a
p1757
aV\u000a\u000aWe will be doing a confernce call tomorrow am @ 10:00 our time with JP Morgan 877-382-9541 passcode 473270 to answer some of the questions, especially the CERA questions.\u000a
p1758
aV\u000a\u000aI want to make sure that we are looking out for our people at this point in time.    If there is someone who is having a particular problem, now is a time to be comforting.   I also want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to reduce spending.   If you have a vacancy, now may be the time to consider do you really have to fill that job right now.\u000a
p1759
aV\u000a\u000aIf you already have forwarded the memo please pass along the warning and ask them not to forward again.\u000a
p1760
aV\u000a\u000aOk, but make sure the documentation of the email follows the invoice for the payment, otherwise we will have to go back to him to appriove the payment.   On the otherhand, there is no reason that a DASH can't be used for non-discretionary approvals as well, and if it doesn't have to go to RAC, then it doesn't.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPer you request:\u000aAlso make sure that <NAME/> Sommers added his name to his list.   There is a separate wind retention program.

aV\u000a\u000aI guess I need some more definition.    If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it, this doesn't make sense.    Can I get some definitions to go over this with <NAME/>?   I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.    Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.   I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.    Especially at the top.\u000a
p1763
aV\u000a\u000aDo you have any critical people that you are afraid you will lose because of the merger?   How about a group?\u000a
p1764
aV\u000a\u000aTell everyone to calm down and get their work done.  Then they should go home.  I know it doesn't help much, but I'm not sure what you can tell everyone at this point.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aThe house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot.. older home that needed some fixing up.  At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.  The <NAME/> Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.  Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare. The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!  However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.  Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.\u000a\u000aWhen we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.  I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.  One day the contractor almost died in the house... he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!  He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!  Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.  It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at <NAME/>.  All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.  \u000a\u000aTalking about wild flowers and plants.. the same is true for Costa Rica.   Plants that only grow indoors with great care in <NAME/> grow like weeds in Costa Rica.  I recommend that on your places to go list.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Christmas, Feliz Natal, and Feliz Navidad\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWe spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open.  Currently, I am making markets on <NAME/> Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market.  In addition, I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast (PJM, NYISO, and NEPOOL) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk.  I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at <NAME/>.  \u000aThe opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the <NAME/> area.  My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida.  I look forward to talking to you soon.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a12:24 16Aug2001 RSF-Canada blisters under "year with too much summer"\u000a\u000a    By Kanina Holmes\u000a    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadians, sometimes divided by regional differences, economic disparities or linguistic snits, find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon -- a national drought.\u000a    From Atlantic to Pacific, from the Arctic to the U.S. border, most of the world's second-largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades.\u000a    "In many ways, this drought is the same tune that's being played right across the country. It's a different look, different season and different impact, but nevertheless, everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country," said <NAME/> Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.\u000a    Whether it's fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec, barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario, many will remember the summer of 2001.\u000a    "It'll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think. Too much excess and not enough normal," said Phillips.\u000a    In parts of British Columbia, water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter's record low snowfall in the mountains.\u000a    "We've had normal summer in terms of rain. But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble," said <NAME/> Mattison, Water Management Director for B.C's Bureau of Sustainable Resources.\u000a    But the devastation is most apparent in Canada's breadbasket, the Prairies. Many farmers, especially in southern <NAME/> and Saskatchewan, have already written off their crops.\u000a    "I've been here since '63. I have never in my life, ever, seen anything like this," <NAME/> Stienwand, a farmer in Castor, <NAME/>, told Reuters.\u000a    "IT'S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION"\u000a    "There's no water. The grasshoppers are so bad. It's beyond your imagination," said Stienwand who farms 1,080 hectares (2,700 acres) of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle.\u000a    It has been so sweltering in his region, located about 160 km (100 miles) west of the Saskatchewan border, that some of Stienwand's farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock.\u000a    "It's just going to destroy a lot of farmers. They're just not going to come out of it," he said.\u000a    In June, the <NAME/> government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds, and, as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested, many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality.\u000a    Last week, the Canadian Wheat Board, the marketer of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley crops, forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports.\u000a    In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see.\u000a    "You wouldn't be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they've got since the twenty-second of June," said Phillips.\u000a    The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario's soybean crop.\u000a    "I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don't see it. It's just really, really, really dry," said <NAME/> Yuck, a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks.\u000a    "When they come on (the radio) every morning and say it's a beautiful sunny day, great to be at the cottage, I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours," said Yuck.\u000a    Canada's largest city, Toronto, has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog, with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C (99 F). Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards.\u000a    An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer.\u000a    "THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER"\u000a    "I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling," said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters.\u000a    "I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer."\u000a    The hot, dry spell could be a blow to the national economy. By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops, aiding farmers, battling forest fires and generating more electricity, it could run into the billions.\u000a    Quebec's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector, which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry's revenues and produces 38 percent of the country's milk, has also been hard hit since early July.\u000a    In southern Quebec, where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity, vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun-ravaged crops.\u000a    "The farmers are on the edge of burn-out, they can barely stand up," said <NAME/> St-Cyr, a spokesman for Quebec's powerful Agricultural Union.\u000a    The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat, the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that, for weeks, have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north.\u000a    Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on <NAME/> <NAME/> Island, growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop. Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins.\u000a    "I think there are a majority of Canadians, probably, who can hardly wait for the winter. And I never thought I'd ever hear that," said Phillips.\u000a    (With additional reporting by <NAME/> Melnbardis in Montreal and <NAME/> Dowd in Vancouver)\u000a    ((Winnipeg Reuters Bureau, 204 947-3548, fax 204 947-5167 email:toronto.newsroom@reuters.com)) \u000aFor Related News, Double Click on one of these codes:\u000a[nN16166160] [E] [U] [CAN] [C] [GRO] [G] [O] [ELN] [MTL] [SOF] [CA] [US] [GRA] [MEAL] [OILS] [LIV] [WEA] [NEWS] [ENV] [ENR] [ELG] [DIS] [HEA] [LEN] [RTRS] \u000a Thursday, 16 August 2001 12:24:30\u000aRSF [Historical News] {C}\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOn Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.

We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.\u000a\u000a1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the <NAME/> grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.\u000a\u000a2.

I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000aHow did you calc the w2 amount of 487,856.  I assume this is the portion of the stock option exerecise that occured after I moved.  If so can I get the calculation for my records.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1858
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aThat sounds reasonable, however, I am looking at taking a different tract (ie.  going without orders and being a merchant company rather than an engineering company).  This has several issues especially capital but we are evaluating it over the next 2 weeks.  I will keep you posted.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS  That's the longest email I've ever written.\u000a

p1860
aV\u000a\u000aBoy does this sound like something that would get fucked up.  Start with <NAME/> Devries in Toronto and let me know what happens.  I didn't even know it was closing.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFirst, congrats on buying a great house for free.  Need to put up a fence in the back because <NAME/> is a pain and somehow convinced me to take done the fence.  We never did figure out the combo for the back door.  \u000a\u000ajohn\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aI'm going to get on <NAME/> Lay's schedule in the next couple of days(assuming he'll let me).  I'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit.  I'm concerned that hoards of people from <NAME/> will show up and that it will be a cluster.  Can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals - p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal.  Also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my <NAME/> meeting.  Write it in bullet point format and quite summarized.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs you would say.  There is good news and bad news.\u000a \u000aThe good - we got the dining room chair.\u000a \u000aThe bad - it was an end/arm chair not a side chair.  Specifically it has two arms but the chair that broke has no arms.\u000a \u000aGood Luck\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1872
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>  \u000a\u000aThis is the format I want.  Can you have someone check the data and then print and deliver a color copy to me and <NAME/> today.  And then update it every week over the next month as we try to finish this process.\u000a
p1873
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>\u000a\u000aI think we should kill the concept of cross calibrating analysts and associates accross business units.  I think this is a waste of time.  We can include them in our business unit PRC's for Managers and Directors.  \u000a\u000aAny comments.\u000a
p1874
aV\u000a\u000aMy thoughts are the same.  You should stay in Canterra.  We can squeeze way more desks on that floor and I'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years.  Given the experience with the walls I would stick to your day job.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p1877
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000aCheck into this.  If these were index trades they should be in our physical volumes not financial.\u000a
p1878
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aYou should meet with <NAME/>.  She is focused on the Power Business.  I will sit in if I'm available.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aOn the California deal.\u000a\u000aCan we possibly get the right to kill the deal 6 months from now if they do not get some credit support.  We may not exercise the option anyway, however, it would be nice to have especially if you could get it for free.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRecession, What Recession.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Creek was full the weekend of the 20th and 21st.  Dorie managed to get me a room.  However, the Golf times were non existant so I figured I would play it by ear and try to book later.  If you and <NAME/> want to join us feel free.  \u000a\u000aThe next weekend the 27th and 28th is the weekend that I may go to Vegas.  I may also stay and play lots of Golf here.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aWith respect to the PPA reserve.\u000a\u000aWe need to adjust the USD reserved based on the currency.  We decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve.  Its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not.  However, the currency was 1.5 CAD to 1 USD when we did it and now 1.565 CAD to 1 USD so the reserve would be 287.5 USD not 300.  We should just adjust this weekly or monthly.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1883
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aThis looks good especially if you get <NAME/>.  What do they want me to be part of if anything.  I was assuming the Breakfast and the Lunch and hopefully the meeting with <NAME/>. Can you let me know so I can set up my schedule. I would like to go see the Toronto office and also get some personal time in.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ait wasn't outrageous.  Call me if he is interested and we will talk about dollars.  Because he will be a VP candidate he will have to interview in <NAME/>.\u000a

p1889
aV\u000a\u000aMaybe you can have a diesal position.  If you can justify it to me and <NAME/> Buy.  Talk to Shankman and see who in his organization runs that product.\u000a
p1890
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPresto got some info the Calpine got a great price on their power sale to California.  Are we negotiating with California and will they agree to credit terms that we like.  It seems like we are going to sell to someone who is going to sell the California.  If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1891
aV\u000a\u000aIt's more related to the size of this transaction and the fact that the transport model apparently doesn't calc var.  I have no fundamental concerns but this one hit me from left field.  On our other issue, I working on getting something in front of you this week.\u000a
p1892
aV\u000a\u000aI've allowed one person to enter <NAME/> America into <NAME/>'s group from Broadband.  We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.  I expect <NAME/> or I to approve any employee who enters <NAME/> America.  I will accept no exuses if someone slips in.\u000a
p1893
aV\u000a\u000aI would love to meet with you and I'm sure <NAME/> would too.  I would also like to take you to dinner.\u000a\u000aLet me know.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aI changed it slightly so I could sleep at night.\u000a\u000aThe top line is just a little joke from me to you.\u000a\u000aLet me know. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1896
aV\u000a\u000aThe east power traders have agreed to post their two ways on EOL for EES.  <NAME/>, you might want to help speed up the administrative process.  It should be minimal effort.\u000a
p1897
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aIf <NAME/> Moutlon wishes to pay for this I'm O.K. with it.  The memory business was never sponsored by North America.  Please get <NAME/> to send me an e-mail acknowleding that he well pay.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1898
aV\u000a\u000aI would offer him the initial contract assuming its what I think it is.  I know that we have base salary issues that we would have to deal with.  I basically told everyone to drop it when <NAME/> proposed his numbers.  Again, the offer to you and him were not meant to be insulting but meant to offer something a year early as we did with a handful of other folks.  We naively thought that these would be accepted quickly.  For everyone else that got offered a re-up a year early, they did exactlty that.  \u000a\u000aLet me know if you want to discuss it further.\u000a
p1899
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aI thought we were hiring 1 person from EBS not two.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Abler was ranked as a strong director.  I will agree, but I hope the quality is as high as you think.  We are going to get tones of resumes from EES and EBS, if your going to blow all you bullets upfront, make sure your getting great people.\u000a
p1900
aV\u000a\u000aThis is bizzare.  Global Markets promised <NAME/> this money and won't seem to write her a check.  It was also a low number relative to what was created for GM.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1901
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to thank everyone for taking the time to interview <NAME/> Shea.  I've known <NAME/> for a long time and tried to hire him on several occasions.  <NAME/> McKay has indicated that he would like to return to <NAME/> for personal reasons later this year and we will need more senior talent in Calgary. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1902
aV\u000a\u000aI mentioned it to <NAME/> breifly and I will re-mention it on the plane.  I think it is higher than 67 Million.  <NAME/> Castleman knows the details.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1903
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000aWhat's up with Manu.  <NAME/> keeps sending me e-mails threatening my life if I don't get an option trader.\u000a
p1904
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aYou might want to spend more time on Cuiaba.  I assume your aware that we are putting all aspects of the project into the accrual bucket including the stuff we once marked.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1905
aV\u000a\u000aI met with Shea in <NAME/>.  Didn't broach the issue on working in Canada for us.  He always puts on a good face about TC but I'm not sure he loves it.  Until recently I was happy with Lambie.  Call me.  We should think about it.\u000a
p1906
aV\u000a\u000aThis is pretty sensitive stuff.  We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.  I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it.\u000a
p1907
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aI'm getting a million e-mails from my people about these committees.  The next time someone puts a bunch of my people on committees, do you think someone could seek my input.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1908
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000aAre you back in town on Monday.  We have a dinner re. the <NAME/> Open.  I'm not sure I can make it because my folks are in town.  Let me know.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1909
aV\u000a\u000aThis could be very dangerous.  \u000a\u000aOPG controls all the megawatts.  \u000a\u000aThey could set the price high and we wouldn't have the ability to do anything about it.  If you could use British energy and get some deal done with OPG to hedge us maybe we would for a few months.\u000a
p1910
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Milnthorp have been discussing whether we want to look for a new regulatory person in Toronto.  We are leaning towards starting with a new face.  Give me a call to discuss.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1911
aV\u000a\u000aI thought <NAME/> was gas.  \u000a\u000aDepending on the cost profile we would probably still do this.  The question is do you buy options on sites, buy sites, and whether or not you pursue permits.\u000a
p1912
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aYou simply can't negotiate on a choice market.  Are your owed past fees for management? Let me know.  I don't run industrial markets and <NAME/> would have to settle this dispute.  You would lose.\u000a
p1913
aV\u000a\u000aYour going to be upset but we are playing Desert Inn on Friday.  Saturday TPC Canyons and some course on Sunday Morning.  Corporate jet home on Sunday Afternoon.  Call Me.\u000a\u000aOxley is coming to round out our Foursome.  You and Ox need to sort out rooms.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI put it on my schedule for July 10th.  Please call me the week before.  My schedule is a little crazy.\u000a
p1916
aV\u000a\u000aSome guy at <NAME/> told <NAME/> Frevert today that on March 15th, <NAME/> won a court ruling saying that they expanded the scope of the PanNat Arbitration.\u000a\u000aTrue?\u000a
p1917
aV\u000a\u000aI couldn't meet with Joon due to PG&E on Friday.  His resume looks good and assuming everyone else likes him, we should hire him.  I assume that this is for associate or is it for associate in the trading tract.  Let me know.  Make sure we get a 3 month evergreen non compete.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1918
aV\u000a\u000aPlease let <NAME/> Hillis (my assistant) know about all the EES meetings planned for this week.  I'm going to try to attend.\u000a

p1920
aV\u000a\u000aWe absolutely should do this.\u000a\u000aWe shouldn't necessarily not get paid.\u000a\u000aThere are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.\u000a\u000aPetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Union\u000a\u000aPeoples - <NAME/> Luce\u000a\u000aEnerconnect - Devries\u000a\u000aMy experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.\u000a
p1921
aV\u000a\u000aFrom the Gas and Power side, we wouldn't need any traders in Montreal, but perhaps some marketers.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Devries in Toronto runs our Eastern Canada operation if you would like to talk to him.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aWe get a much different story from our appointed arbitrator for PAN NAT.  Although the main arbitrator did not do exactly what we wanted he had strong words to <NAME/> that they had no support for their position.  We would like to ignore their pleas to settle because they have been making very unreasonable settlement offers.  \u000aAs we understand it arbitration starts July 1.  I'll talk to you more next week.  If you want an update prior call <NAME/> Sanders.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGrigs,\u000a\u000aI talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In <NAME/>'s opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. <NAME/> this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI need to top up my RRSP for 2001. My contribution limit from my tax return for 2000 is $10881. I have contributed about $5500 through <NAME/> and <NAME/> has contributed $3200 to my pension plan. Am I correct to assume that I can contribute about $2000. The part I wasn't sure about was the pension contributions.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.\u000a\u000aPurchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND\u000aDuty on this amount = 3300\u000aGST on this amount = 3800\u000aExcise tax = 180\u000aPermits = 400\u000a\u000aPlus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500\u000a\u000aThat brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from <NAME/> to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.\u000a\u000aHardly seems like the best option.\u000a\u000aAlso, I called <NAME/> moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to <NAME/> was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:\u000a\u000aMovers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)\u000aFlight = $1500 CND\u000aHotel = $1500 CND\u000aOctober Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in <NAME/> that expires at the end of October)\u000a\u000aThe total of the above is $11 800.\u000a

I am pushing for a 4 day work week. \u000aWhy Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in <NAME/> so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, <NAME/> in the arm pit of the world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. <NAME/> has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can. \u000a\u000a<NAME/> got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for me anyway (31). \u000a\u000aGlad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to visit some time.

Or is NY home for a while? \u000a\u000aNo Vacation plans other than that I am going to <NAME/> and Jen's wedding this weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday. My friend <NAME/> from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.\u000a\u000aMy family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.\u000a\u000aHow is <NAME/> doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her. I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her. I hope all goes well for her. <NAME/> did go to D's wedding. Said it was really nice.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aA short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.\u000a\u000aI. Projects (in the order they suggested it).\u000a\u000a	1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market\u000a	factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.\u000a\u000a	2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without\u000a	full trade automation.\u000a\u000a	3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.\u000a \u000aII. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments \u000a   per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.\u000a\u000a	1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of \u000a	    <NAME/>'s participation.\u000a\u000a	2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.\u000a\u000a	3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through\u000a	    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support\u000a	    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify\u000a	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.\u000a\u000a\u000aRecommendations:\u000a\u000a	1. A visit to Santa Fe with <NAME/> <NAME/> to discuss an equity investment.\u000a\u000a	2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship\u000a                with UBS.\u000a\u000a	3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to <NAME/> from\u000a	    Prediction Company.\u000a

This validate svery well the\u000ademand model.\u000a\u000aGetting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because\u000aother regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas\u000aavailable in the short run. We have some good insights into this\u000aproblem as well.\u000a\u000aMy concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to <NAME/>.\u000aI have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures\u000ato keep them away from critical information.\u000aPlease, let me know how far we can go with <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aI am ready to help you with baseball.

As soon as they will decide\u000ato move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the \u000aproduct. As I have  said, we are not the \u000adecision makers in this case. \u000a\u000aI think that we should allow simply the process to run its course.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHe looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive\u000ahundreds of such resumes.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAnother interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place.\u000a\u000aAs you know, Brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage. About\u000a95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of\u000awater in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge\u000aexposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.\u000a\u000aMeasuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil \u000aare asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting\u000atechnical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These\u000aobjections may not apply to Brazil.\u000a\u000aCan we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from\u000aSao Paulo to discuss the problem?

aV\u000a\u000aA few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more\u000acontroversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would\u000alike to share with you a few observations.\u000a\u000a1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to\u000a<NAME/> (and the P/E ratio).\u000a\u000aA number of recent analysts' reports characterized <NAME/> as a hedge fund engaged in\u000amassive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this\u000acrirticism is to emphasize the quality of <NAME/>'s risk amnageemnt system and\u000aour strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management\u000atechnology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.\u000a\u000aIt is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can\u000aconvince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about\u000athe quality of our financial technology. This can be done \u000athrough targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.\u000aby reality.\u000a\u000a2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.\u000a\u000aThe VaR system used in <NAME/> is based on the assumption that as much input\u000ainformation as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to\u000athe market observations (as opposed to historical data).\u000a\u000aOne immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks\u000ainformation and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.\u000a\u000aOne should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the\u000atrading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect\u000abetween the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices \u000acurves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized \u000aforward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will \u000asystematically fail. \u000a\u000aOne way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically\u000afwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the \u000asource of problems we see in some books.\u000a\u000a3. VaR process management.\u000a\u000aGiven the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,\u000aa system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.\u000aWhat is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality\u000aof the results.\u000a\u000aSpecifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility\u000afor the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization\u000aand resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have\u000ainputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used \u000acurrently in the system are 2 years old.\u000a\u000aAnother aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view \u000asome recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal\u000ausefulness (and in some case on questionable\u000aunderstanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to\u000abring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties\u000a\u000aand\u000a

p2842
aV\u000a\u000aAre we proposing to pay refco for order flow, like a tick per trade, or are we going to give them our prices and then they widen them to add their juice?\u000a
p2843
aV\u000a\u000ai really have no idea.  probably lower just becasue of the trend and overwhelming bearish view of the market.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000athe way i read it was the 30 something contract signed are good but ones under negotiation from there are either being renegotiated or talks terminated.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aeverybody and their mom is short. Plus, a lot of people think the z/f is too wide so either the front needs to go up or the back down.\u000a\u000anope\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aSorry for the delay.  Unfotunately I don't have any openings in my group right now.  If I hear of any positions open I'll give you a shout.  Can you remind me what title you have now.   \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2849

aV\u000a\u000aThere will be a desk head mtg tomorrow, Sunday, at 3:00 on the 33rd floor per Lavorato to discuss positions and strategy.  Please confirm via email.  My cell # is 713 557 3330 if there are any problems.\u000a
p2852
aV\u000a\u000amaybe we just hold all the gas until next winter.  we'll worry about that problem next september.  \u000anovy expiry can go anywhere.  Too early to say.   Probably around $2 though as I cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the US is a net injector the first 1-2 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing.\u000a
p2853
aV\u000a\u000adid not, but I went to my wine locker and picked out 12 bottles for the weekend so I think we're okay unless you're taking some to your friends.  I'll call you when I'm ready and we'll figure it out.\u000a
p2854
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aDeutsche Bank asked me to ask you to call their maintenance margin person, <NAME/> Jones, at 212 469 6773.  I think they are trying to margin us.  \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2855
aV\u000a\u000ain regards to the stock, tell me about it.  \u000aflat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while. think the next push down doesnt come again until late october.  im buying z 300/250 put spread for 11.  still looking for 3.1 by end of season.  probably 2.95-3.0 for nov 31.  who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario?\u000aaga's... think high 70's is neutral the market.  if it comes out 70-85 you can shit on vol.  that'd be good for me.\u000a
p2856
aV\u000a\u000aI actually went to go talk to him yesterday but he was already gone and he's on vacation today.  I'll talk to him next week.  Probably better for him to hear the benfits from my mouth.  We do need to talk to him before we get too far.  \u000a \u000aEOL working very well as of late.\u000a
p2857
aV\u000a\u000aWe have the whole curve out.  The nymex is just another trading platform that is inconsequential to markets we make except for arb opportunities and for the fact that our swaps settle against the nymex settlement.  our volume is pretty normal at this point.\u000a
p2858
aV\u000a\u000ame thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness.  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the US the dollar should remain fairly strong.  however, if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be, the turnaround will be very quick.\u000a
p2859
aV\u000a\u000aHello, I noticed you carried several of the 98 Zoom Zins.  Any chance you have the 33 year old vines version?  Please advise,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI want to have a group mtg from 4:00-5:00 today to discuss some of the enron issues and then vol if we have a chance.\u000a
p2862
aV\u000a\u000aWith the daily chaos that ensues on this floor, sometimes communication is sacrificed.  Fortunately, we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information.  I think all of us, including myself, underutilize this tool.  I want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long.  In addition, I want everybody to post at least one message every day.  This can be an interesting trade that just happened, what counterparties are trying to do, new information you uncovered, etc.  Information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if we're taking info from the board, we should be contributing as well.\u000a
p2863
aV\u000a\u000ai've been selling.  was long 500 and selling out.  everybody will  be expecting the crude draws.  they dont matter.  think this is tremendously bearish all energy demand.  supply shocks are the only question, but I dont think US will end up fighting a war against the middle east.  Who cares if we nuke afghanistan?\u000a
p2864
aV\u000a\u000aScary how we have the same sense of humor.  Havent told anybody yet.  So I have a favor to ask: whether we never talk again, just become good friends, or grow old together with 6 kids, please never,ever refer to me as the energy guy.  You can refer to him as that, just not me.  \u000aOfficially tired of watching the news.  Actually there is very little new about it.  Channel 12: the local viewpoint.  CNN: the national viewpoint.  CNBC:  the business viewpoint.  ESPN: the sports viewpoint.  <NAME/> Robertson Channel: God's viewpoint.  The politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing.  "We interrupt the State Dept's news conference to bring you the Justice Dept's news conference where we expect there going to say 'no comment at this time' frequently."  I have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens, but meanwhile it's driving me nuts.\u000aJust found out another girl I knew is missing. I was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through.  I met her after that.  \u000aSo let's talk about something better.  We'll start shallow.  What kind of music do you like?  \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2865
aV\u000a\u000ayour guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this level though.\u000a
p2866
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aThe trade did go in yesterday to book "oil-price-spec".  If this is not the right book, email or call.\u000ajohn\u000a
p2867
aV\u000a\u000arules to a game:\u000aYou flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you $1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?  what you charge me play against you?)\u000a
p2868
aV\u000a\u000ai felt fine.  i ate a breakfast bar before i went.  normally dont do that.  wont be doing that again.\u000a\u000awanna do something tonight?  what time do you get out of here?\u000a
p2869
aV\u000a\u000awhat do they mean when they have a cold summer scenario results in a $1.50 price?  these guys are freaks.\u000a
p2870
aV\u000a\u000athink trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowing that tropical activity will develop at some point.  however, think the failure from 335 last thursday will weigh on people.  think that nobody wants to own above 325, only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 5-10 cents higher unless aga is very bullish.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aNot so impressed with <NAME/> goldman.  For a guy who has worked in derivatives for 10 years, couldnt answer some simple questions.  Very poor financial derivatives knowledge even though he worked at CRT for a long time and a Lyonnais for a while.  The only value I see in him is that he worked at BP for a while and might have some knowledge as to how they work.\u000a
p2873
aV\u000a\u000aremind jim how the h/j/k spread acted this year.  granted it won't behave that way again until close to expiry, but i like the j/k outright much moreso than the condor.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI'm running out the door to go drinking with the boys at front porch, right next to my apartment.  \u000a\u000aI don't think your dad would like me so much.  <NAME/> explain later.\u000a\u000aSorry about your day.

p2876
aV\u000a\u000anot really.  i actually don't think the market's going to move too much even though the range of expectations is huge.  there are enough people on the sidelines to mute a move either way\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGad:\u000aSorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that <NAME/> referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000amost bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.\u000a

p2897
aV\u000a\u000ai just cant get too enthused about the short side.  why did cash go out trading +5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand.  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week.  fine.  what's it going to trade next week.  the gas daily swap implies flat, but it's lagged the actual spread all month.  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen.  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space.  so either the market is wrong (maybe but a dangerous assumption to make) or I don't see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve.  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high, but those certainly don't seem to be going down very fast.  march is off 8 cents since jun 29.  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354, then why is sep too high at 298?\u000a

The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aHere is my analysis of my guys:\u000a<NAME/> Maggi (2) : P@L for first half a bit misleading.  Up till today, he has run and taken the P&L for 7 days.  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in July so far.  Running EOL is a law of averages...some days you get killed some you do well.  The second day he got massacred: T boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day.  P&L for that day was -$7.  the four days in july have been really good, probably +$6-7.  So I look at his P&L for the first half of the year as Jan 1-Jul 6.  That P&L of $15 is around my expectations.  runs low var.  pretty good at running EOL when I'm not there.  A little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help.  makes most money in market making, probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift.  Would like for him to turn both of those positive.  A bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info.  Required to spend all time in front of computer.  needs to develop <NAME/> Griffith to allow him to get off the desk more.  good contrarian trader.  often has opposite position of floor.  willing to stop out and is nimble.  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody' elses positions.  Vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now.  Cannot function without one of us on the desk. \u000aComputer causing problems.  will email with other guys later.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey:\u000a1.  Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote.  This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal.   Agree about liquidity.  I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity.  Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state.  \u000a2.  My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity.  For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive.  \u000a\u000aImportant Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aof course.  info here goes nowhere. we've had trouble discerning where the switching takes place because the economics get very blurry: credits, ldc costs, transport, taxes, restrictions on # hours plants can burn resis are hard to account for and are different for everybody.   also some noneconomic factors... convenience, inertia, multi-month fuel purchases, hedges, accounting procedures, resid in storage already...  It's a big blur in my mind.  I look at general levels and for anecdotal evidence.  have seen zero anecdotal evidence so far.  will also watch aga's for the indication,  but so will everybody else.\u000a
p2918
aV\u000a\u000aexaggerations...word travels everywhere doesnt it?  how'd you hear?\u000a\u000ame thinks everybody short and everybody wants the market to go down.  I'm relatively flat and would love to squeeze all the fuckers out so I can sell them 20 cents higher.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000acost about 200,000-300,000\u000a\u000a	our internal estimates were in the 102-106 range, so no.  i think pira overestimating the gas gen burn for the week.  problem is there is no real good burn for at least two weeks going forward.  we've dropped $1.5 in a couple months and havent picked up an mmbtu of demand.  that's a big problem\u000a
p2932
aV\u000a\u000amy email as far as i know is jarnold@enron.com.  not on msn though.\u000ai made space for your 8 people as well as ferries, roberts, and the other person (??) you requested.  Come down tomorrow and i'll show you the layout again.\u000ajohn\u000a
p2933
aV\u000a\u000aI'm big seller of interventions.  they tend not to work.  if the gas market wants to go lower, enron coming out and buying 10,000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down.  maybe in the short term, but that's it.  same with currencies.  ECB can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to Euros, but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point.  i think it is more psychological than anything.  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective.\u000a
p2934
aV\u000a\u000ai think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here.\u000a
p2935
aV\u000a\u000ang lows in place but q1 forecast $2.2  ???  \u000adon't understand.\u000aalso, what's longer term forecast i.e. past mar 03\u000a
p2936
aV\u000a\u000abiggest question in my mind is we assume resid is a fixed target or if resid needs to keep market share and as natty drops so does resid to maintain its market.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPrompt month vol is moving from 60% to 40% cob today...should increase capacity for front month by 50% for anybody who wants them.\u000a

p2939
aV\u000a\u000ai don't have a problem with that.  The 3 factors I ask in releasing info are:\u000a\u000a	1. Do customers even know the info is available or useful?\u000a	2. Is the info publicly available?\u000a	3. Is the info easily obtainable?\u000a\u000a	In this case, the answer is yes to all three, so I don't care.  If the answer is no to one or more of the above, a judgment call has to be made.\u000a
p2940
aV\u000a\u000aTell them that margin will be posted as normal, no excess nor any intraday calls.  Since ENE is flush with liquidity, he should be very comfortable that we can pay our bills.  The positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will x-pit everything out of Man and close the account.  Anything different and all dealings between Man and <NAME/> in energy will be terminated in both OTC and futures.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aBBB+ credits dont go bankrupt overnight.  we can get downgraded overnight, though.  put a clause in the contract that if we get downgraded below inv grade there is some sort of orderly liquidation of the swaps.  talk to credit about how we handle this with others.\u000a
p2944
aV\u000a\u000athere are few scenarios whereby that spread comes in except if you take it to settlement.  if dec is strong, jan is strong too.  if dec is weak, jan retains some risk premium.\u000a

p2948
aV\u000a\u000a1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.\u000a2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a $2.50-3.50 commodity.  \u000a3. the obvious\u000a4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall.\u000a5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aUnderstand.  <NAME/> has been Man's biggest account for years and during that time we have paid them a lot in commissions.  They approached us on Wednesday to try to increase the margin required, even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5+ years ago.  I refused to agree to change the margin calculations.  It became clear that Man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that Man is a relatively small shop.  I agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account.  At the same time I told them I was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handle/didnt want the clearing business I would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make.  Clear our business always, or clear it never.  Paribas has stuck with us throughout and I intend to clear the majority of future biz with Paribas.  I agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday, which we did, but the rest of the position would stay there.  They agreed.  We specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would stay and we would work out those positions over time.  &!@$ them if they are trying to go back on that.\u000a

In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFertilizers brochure - final text file 2001\u000a \u000a[Cover]\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aIt's time to manage your price risk.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a[Spread 1]\u000aManaging Price Risk\u000aFor producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. <NAME/> can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions. \u000a \u000aHelping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business\u000aFew industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows.\u000aNow there's help. For many years, <NAME/> has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because <NAME/> is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. \u000a<NAME/> can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using <NAME/>Online, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. <NAME/>Online posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products.\u000a[Spread 2]\u000aFinally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.\u000a\u000aHelping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business\u000a\u000aThe ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to <NAME/>. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. \u000aTake a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with <NAME/>. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure.\u000a[Spread 3]\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aSwaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. \u000aSwaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed.\u000aThe typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party.\u000a[Spread 4]\u000a\u000aSwap: Producer example \u000a\u000aAmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with <NAME/> that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target.\u000a[chart 1]\u000a\u000aDURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:\u000a\u000a?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices.\u000a?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and <NAME/> exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread.\u000a?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to <NAME/>.\u000a?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.\u000a \u000a[Spread 5]\u000a\u000aSwap: End-user example \u000a\u000aFertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales.\u000a[chart 2]\u000a\u000aDURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:\u000a\u000a?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices.\u000a?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and <NAME/> exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia.\u000a?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to <NAME/>.\u000a?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton.\u000a?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.\u000a \u000a[Spread 6]\u000a\u000aCAPS & FLOORS\u000a\u000aLike Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price "insurance," i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential.\u000aWith a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements.\u000a[Spread 7]\u000a\u000aCap: End-User example\u000a\u000aCropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay.\u000aTo distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked.\u000aThe prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton.\u000a[chart 3]\u000a\u000aDURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:\u000a\u000a?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices.\u000a?        <NAME/> receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap.\u000a?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, <NAME/> will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock.\u000a?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap.\u000a?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.\u000a \u000a[Spread 8]\u000a\u000aFloor: Producer example\u000a\u000aAmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time.\u000aTo protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton).\u000a[chart 4]\u000a \u000a\u000aEACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:\u000a\u000a?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices.\u000a?        <NAME/> receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor.\u000a?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium.\u000a?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from <NAME/>. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium.\u000a?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.\u000a \u000a[Spread 9]\u000aYour sales, profits and cash flows are too important to be left to today's volatile market.

I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.  The <NAME/> lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get away even close to on time?\u000a\u000aThanks again!\u000a
p2990
aV\u000a\u000aThanks - can you guys draft up the Schedule I on a cost-plus basis?\u000a
p2991
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> -- Please send the requested info to <NAME/>.  Thanks!  <NAME/>\u000a
p2992
aV\u000a\u000aI believe credit is trying to decide what to do considering the recent changes in the airlines' positions.\u000a
p2993
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> said you had been trying to reach me.  I've tried to call several times but still haven't been able to get through to you on the phone. I tired to send this yesterday but it may not have gotten through.\u000a
p2994
aV\u000a\u000aI hope it was ok to respond to this - because I did.\u000a
p2995
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/> -- here are my details:\u000a\u000a<NAME/> E. Taylor '78\u000a1322 Rutland St.\u000a<NAME/>, TX 77008\u000a(713)863-7190 (home)\u000amark.taylor@enron.com\u000a\u000aLet me know how I can help.\u000a
p2996
aV\u000a\u000aFYI - I will stick my head in today.\u000a
p2997
aV\u000a\u000aWe're almost there on the new PA language, just a little tweaking left to do.  I'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until Monday.  I agree with your comment on the Pop - up language - probably something to the effect of "Not at this time."\u000a
p2998
aV\u000a\u000aPlease coordinate with <NAME/>.\u000a
p2999
aV\u000a\u000aFYI  Looks like we may get free passes to the boat show!\u000a
p3000
aV\u000a\u000aIs there a call-in number for this meeting?  (I'll be in NYC.)\u000a

p3004
aV\u000a\u000aOops.  Sorry, I'll bring them by.\u000a
p3005
aV\u000a\u000aIf you want to plug me in to your call with <NAME/> to describe the enhanced limit order system, just let me know.\u000a
p3006
aV\u000a\u000alooks good to me - do I need to approve this in the system?\u000a
p3007
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Sayre will be working on this matter while <NAME/> is on vacation.\u000a
p3008
aV\u000a\u000aWhat about <NAME/>?  Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet?\u000a
p3009
aV\u000a\u000aThanks  <NAME/>, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date (there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees?\u000a
p3010
aV\u000a\u000aI'll be there.  Large/0413/105657\u000a
p3011
aV\u000a\u000aAny comments to the letter?\u000a
p3012
aV\u000a\u000aAny entity, whether or not an <NAME/> entity, that posts its products on the Website will be a third party beneficiary of this Password Application and the ETA to the same extent as if it were an affiliate of <NAME/>Online, LLC.  <NAME/> may give Counterparty's name to potential product  providers as a prospective counterparty.\u000a
p3013
aV\u000a\u000aI thought of another item to add to the list:\u000a\u000aCruising World 2002 wall calendar -- available on Amazon.com for 11.95\u000a
p3014
aV\u000a\u000aSounds like a plan to me.  Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.\u000a\u000aYou might try these:\u000a\u000aIn Sedona:\u000a  Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)\u000a\u000aIn Scottsdale/Phoenix:\u000a  Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews)\u000a  The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool)\u000a  The Boulders (also highly rated)\u000a\u000aAt the Canyon\u000a  El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)\u000a\u000aIn Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon):\u000a  The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon\u000a
p3015
aV\u000a\u000aYes.  <NAME/> was concerned that Dynegy was already doing this to manipulate a Canadian index to which we contribute daily volumes/prices.\u000a
p3016
aV\u000a\u000aI'm going to be up near Kingston on Labor Day weekend.  Just wondered if you were going to be open and if you rent sailboats by the hour, either bareboat or skippered.\u000a
p3017
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for that, <NAME/>.  I am stranded here in London and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that I am an American and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said: that we are under appreciated the world round, that the <NAME/> Plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation, if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us, could have resisted, as we have, using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world.\u000a
p3018
aV\u000a\u000aII made my pledge some time ago so am concerned to hear my name is on the list.  I'll try again.\u000a
p3019
aV\u000a\u000aAre you guys working on this already?\u000a
p3020
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the revised review (password - oberon).  I have meetings scheduled for the afternoon and am not sure I will be able to get out of them at any particular time.  Does it make sense to give her the review without me being there and meet later or not?\u000a
p3021
aV\u000a\u000aLooks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).\u000a
p3022
aV\u000a\u000aI made it back to <NAME/> last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home.\u000a
p3023
aV\u000a\u000aPlease call me:\u000a(713)853-7459\u000a
p3024
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> will be responding from <NAME/>.  She is conferring with the traders this morning.\u000a
p3025
aV\u000a\u000aI'm not sure which version this is but you'll no doubt be revising anyway.\u000a
p3026
aV\u000a\u000aLet's plan on it.  My only question is whether I'll be able to come on Friday eve. or have to wait until Sat. a.m.  Do you have plans that would make one day better than the other?  I have a 4:00 flight back to <NAME/> on Sunday afternoon and will be able to get a rent car at the Newark airport so you won't have to worry about transport for me.\u000a
p3027
aV\u000a\u000aI asked for a return date for you of September 12 which is the day I'm coming back.  But since I will be going to <NAME/> and you will be going to NYC we won't be traveling together anyway.  Would you rather stay an extra day or two?\u000a
p3028
aV\u000a\u000aSince they are already trading physical stuff online, they are probably already approved to trade financials as well and the master will just mean they don't have to accept the GTC's to trade the derivatives.  <NAME/> can check quickly and see what they are approved for.\u000a
p3029
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aI also received a message form an AA person asking for rate/FX templates.  I know we are supposed to come up with a set of approved templates but we don't yet have a process in place.  I thought we had until next year sometime.  My guess is that the most current source is the work you did a couple of years ago on confirms.  \u000a\u000aScary, hunh?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3030
aV\u000a\u000aSorry for the delay -- these look fine to me.\u000a
p3031
aV\u000a\u000aIf this doesn't work, I can just send you the three whole presentations.  Let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3032
aV\u000a\u000aI was working in the NY office on 9/4 and here in the London office since 9/10.\u000a
p3033
aV\u000a\u000aSince I have to attend the <NAME/> Net Works staff meetings Thursdays at noon, might it be possible to pick a different day?\u000a
p3034
aV\u000a\u000aCould one of you please take a look at the red-lined language in the attachment and let me know if it is ok to approve it.  Thanks!\u000a
p3035
aV\u000a\u000aNet Works is not a marketing affiliate.  We can make changes if they want us to.\u000a
p3036
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the first of the no-more-confirms agreement.  Power and Gas have already made their changes so now it's our turn.  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> also have counterparties they are working on.\u000a
p3037
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/> - this is it.\u000a
p3038
aV\u000a\u000aI'll be getting into Newark on Saturday the first on Continental flight 206 at 2:21 p.m.\u000a
p3039
aV\u000a\u000aPlease remember to get your work report updates to me by the end of the day.\u000a
p3040
aV\u000a\u000aWe discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for EnronOnline transactions in our last group meeting.  It looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals.  No one should end up with more than two or three of them that way.  <NAME/> Moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the power-specific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group.  The gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivatives-specific provisions.\u000a
p3041
aV\u000a\u000aHere's another which <NAME/> hasn't seen yet.\u000a
p3042
aV\u000a\u000aAre we getting this?\u000a
p3043
aV\u000a\u000aThis wasn't on my calendar - were you aware?\u000a
p3044
aV\u000a\u000aOctober 2, 2001\u000a \u000aMs. <NAME/> D.

p3045
aV\u000a\u000aIt would probably be a good idea to involve the power traders in this as well since it is not just an EnronOnline issue.\u000a
p3046
aV\u000a\u000aIt appears this was handled by the Calgary office.  <NAME/> Johnston will give you a call.\u000a
p3047
aV\u000a\u000aDo I assume correctly that dinner is at home in NJ rather than at home in NY?\u000a
p3048
aV\u000a\u000aCan you help <NAME/> with this?  <NAME/> and <NAME/> are both out tomorrow, <NAME/> is supposed to get the form for the Commodity Logic matters finished and <NAME/> can't really take anything new until Monday.  I don't think <NAME/> and <NAME/> have enough ISDA experience to look at somebody else's paper quickly.  If you are swamped, maybe you can get this started (I doubt if they even have credit approval yet) and somebody else can take it over next week.\u000a
p3049
aV\u000a\u000aUnder normal circumstances we would not need an <NAME/> Corp. resolution and in fact the Corporate Secretary and Treasury offices can handle moving the money around so we do not propose to do an <NAME/> Corp. Board action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary.  The other resolutions we can get in place easily.\u000a\u000aI think Notre Dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed -- does that mean we need to issue the Golden Share today?\u000a
p3050
aV\u000a\u000aHopefully just a nuisance.\u000a
p3051
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.  I'll take care of it and give RBS a call tomorrow.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3052
aV\u000a\u000aRats - I thought I had picked a day when we were all going to be here - your day off was not listed on my group calendar.  Sorry!\u000a
p3053
aV\u000a\u000aWhile I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.\u000a
p3054
aV\u000a\u000aEOL67313\u000aWELCOME!\u000a
p3055
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Gros and the Commodity Logic team will be presenting a demo tomorrow of the various modules which go live in the next week or so.  The demos are scheduled for 1:30 to 2:30 and 3:00 to 4:00 tomorrow afternoon in EB5C2.  Please feel free to attend one of the sessions if you are interested.\u000a
p3056
aV\u000a\u000aAfter a two and a half hour delay -- mostly caused by the extra security -- we finally got off the ground yesterday and I am now back in <NAME/>.  I talked to <NAME/> after I checked in and she said you were on the train to the airport.  Did you have any trouble?\u000a
p3057
aV\u000a\u000aCongratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.\u000a\u000aGiven the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.  If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.  As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.\u000a
p3058
aV\u000a\u000aI'll be on the call.\u000a
p3059
aV\u000a\u000aSounds like you have this under control.  I agree with your approach.\u000a
p3060
aV\u000a\u000aIf you have not already done so this week, please remember to update your work reports for me this afternoon.\u000a
p3061
aV\u000a\u000aThis is a swap confirm.  Do you have an option?\u000a
p3062
aV\u000a\u000aTo the extent you need my authorization or approval regarding the trading database, you've got it.  If you have any questions, <NAME/> can probably help.\u000a
p3063
aV\u000a\u000aDoes your analysis change if the license is expanded to include both source and object code licenses with the right to the licensee grant sublicenses?\u000a
p3064
aV\u000a\u000aWe've actually completed this as far as I know -- negotiated the agreement and signed it last week.\u000a
p3065
aV\u000a\u000aLet's go ahead and make her an offer to start as soon as she can - that may not be until September but if she can make it sooner that would be great.\u000a
p3066
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you guys be around the first weekend in August?  I have to be in nyc the 1st & 2nd on business - thought I'd check and see what you were up to.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3067
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aThanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3068
aV\u000a\u000aPlease see me before responding to <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aThanks,  <NAME/>\u000a
p3069
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.\u000a\u000aIt has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.\u000a\u000aIt's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know <NAME/> was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.\u000a\u000aTell <NAME/> I said Hi.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3070
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your note.  I am stranded in London and won't be able to get back until they start international flights again and I can get a seat.  Looks like that means Sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me, too on Friday night.\u000a
p3071
aV\u000a\u000aSorry about that.  I have been a bit preoccupied.  I put them in the car so I would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so I could stop at the post office.  It turns out the neighborhood office is closed on Saturdays and of course they were all closed on Monday.  You should have them tomorrow.\u000a
p3072
aV\u000a\u000aSorry for the delay.  I will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Otherwise, how about Monday August 6 at 10:00, 2:00 or 3:00?\u000a
p3073
aV\u000a\u000aI think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for - just be very careful to try and minimize expenses.\u000a
p3074
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> -- would you please revise <NAME/>'s group list to delete <NAME/> A Taylor and add me as <NAME/> E Taylor?  Thanks!\u000a
p3075
aV\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, it's each one comes from a different presentation -- here are all three:\u000a Slide 3\u000a Slide 9\u000a Value Proposition Slide 31\u000a
p3076
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Koehler is probably the best person to talk to.  She has indicated she will have some time in the morning.\u000a
p3077
aV\u000a\u000aLooks good to me\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the idea -- I may need it sooner than I expected.  It's nice to know there are jobs out there but I think I can hold out until I find one somewhere better than Boise -- if you thought nobody wanted to visit <NAME/>......!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMy flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft. Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these that looked interesting:\u000a\u000a\u000aBistro Mezzaluna\u000aArmadillo Cafe (Davie)\u000aLeft Bank\u000aHobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)\u000a<NAME/> & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)\u000a\u000aNot sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.\u000a

p3083
aV\u000a\u000aKelly:\u000a\u000aThanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:\u000a\u000aNot sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.\u000a\u000aThe Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.\u000a\u000aI've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.\u000a\u000a On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!\u000a\u000aI'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI hope you can all join us for happy hour tomorrow from 6:00 at <NAME/>'s Wine Bar.  <NAME/>'s is located at 2516 Times Blvd. in Rice Village.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThat's what he goes by.\u000a
p3090
aV\u000a\u000aI have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and <NAME/> have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.\u000a\u000aThe difficulty is that <NAME/> has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!\u000a\u000aThey will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?\u000a

p3110
aV\u000a\u000aI'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  <NAME/> and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for <NAME/>).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.\u000a\u000aIn a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.\u000a\u000aFrom her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on <NAME/> has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.\u000a\u000aFeel free to give me a call if you want to chat.\u000a\u000aGood luck!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?\u000a\u000aOn the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3122
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (<NAME/> can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice.\u000a
p3123
aV\u000a\u000aI think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.\u000a\u000aHow do we convince customers to participate?\u000aTwo distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.\u000a\u000aNew business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.\u000a\u000aExisting business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.\u000a\u000a\u000aIssues:\u000a\u000aRequires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.\u000a	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?\u000a	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.\u000a	\u000aContract hurdles:\u000a\u000a	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so <NAME/> (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.\u000a	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.\u000a	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).\u000a\u000aIf we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?\u000a\u000aIt's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  <NAME/> we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (<NAME/> customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)\u000a\u000aOnce the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, <NAME/> will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  \u000a\u000aWhen all of the contracts are terminated with <NAME/> as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSan <NAME/>, Oct. 18, 2001 (Forestweb) - Weyerhaeuser Co. will increase the U.S. price of its northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) price by $20/tonne to $500/tonne effective Nov. 1, according to a buyer source. Another buyer source said Weyerhaeuser has increased his price by $20/tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys, "and I assume on the others." Weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment. Weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the U.S. price of $480/tonne for Oct. 1, when other North American producers went to $500/tonne. The competitors have complained that Weyerhaeuser's price was a drag on their efforts. Producers and buyers alike have said that $500/tonne has been a hard sell in October, partly because of the market, but also because demand has been so slow. A number of sources say NBSK is at $480/tonne for October, though a few are paying the $500/tonne price. "I don't think we will pay $500 (in November)," a buyer said today. "I think it will be $490." An agent today described the Weyerhaeuser news as "a plus," but added, "Now all we need is for demand to pick up." Another agent also responded cautiously. "There is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up, certainly not in the paper business. Without that, (producers) can announce what they want to, but it is not a slam dunk," he said. As for October transaction , aid that in most cases, they didn't move. "I know everyone needs (price increases) and I know the inventories have gone down, but my feeling is they will go up again," he said, noting typical late-fall patterns.  said that in contrast to the past, paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices. "It's going to be a battle, for sure," he said. "There's a lot of fighting going on, a lot (of buyers) are saying they're not going to pay it."\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Worldwide chemical paper-grade market pulp producer inventories declined 66,000 tonnes in August from the prior month, according to preliminary data from the Pulp and Paper Products Council in Montreal. August marked the sixth month in a row that world inventories had fallen as producers dropped their stocks 1.9 percent from opening levels. \u000aWorld producer stocks closed August at 3.402 million tonnes, representing 37 days of supply, a day less than July results. Producer inventory levels are 33.3 percent higher than year-ago figures, when world producers held 28 days of supply. Although stocks are still high on a year-over-year basis, recent results still represented a strong improvement. Back in June, world producer stocks were 74.8 percent higher than the same period last year. \u000aAugust production of 2.683 million tonnes declined 2.3 percent from last month and tumbled 10.3 percent vs. year-ago results of 2.992 million tonnes. Global shipments totaled 2.750 million tonnes, dipping 1.9 percent from the 2.698 million tonnes recorded in August of last year. \u000aProducers operated at 88 percent of capacity in August, the same rate as both June and July of this year. That compared to world producers' year-ago operating rate of 103 percent. Meanwhile, the shipment-to-capacity ratio, considered an indicator of producer discipline, advanced 2 points from the prior month to 90 percent, PPPC reported. \u000aWorld inventory figures include totals from North America, Nordic countries, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Swaziland. Countries that do not report inventories include Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand. \u000aWorld producers shifted 26,000 tonnes between the close of July and last month's opening inventories.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHello <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aIt's been a long time since I last wrote you but here I am again. I am still working for <NAME/>, but I moved away from Oregon. Now me and my husband are living in <NAME/>, Texas. \u000aI worked in Portland until May of this year and then I though of moving away from Oregon just because opportunities are not as big there. In Portland I wroked as a power real time trader buying and selling power real time. I got tired of that job because of shift work. This summer I joined the forests products department and right now I do analysis for the traders. I ahve taken a couple of derivatives classes offered in the company and plan to take some more. My goal is to move to a trader's position, mostly financial trader to work with derivatives but we will see what happens. Right now I am learning about the market, and how it functions. \u000a\u000aI plan on taking some classes next term at Rice University in <NAME/>. I need to have better mathematical skills and I will start taking math classes at night after work. We will see how this goes. i have to prepare myself well for the future. \u000a\u000aThat's all on work side. \u000aMoving to <NAME/> was quite a change. The  weather especially. Right now though the weather is great, it's sunny and in the mid-70s to 80s. I love it. Koli likes Portland better. <NAME/> is a much bigger city and a little more dangerous. I like it though, what I miss is Corvallis and school. I miss business school at OSU and studying for finance classes. I want to go back to school eventually and get both MBA and PHD so I can teach. I would love to be a professor. \u000a\u000aSo how are you? How is your wife? Your kids? Is anything new happening? What about your parents in NY? Are they OK from all that has happened?  \u000aWhat about OSU? Anything new there? How is prof. Moulton? Say hi to him from me. What about the students? Are you still demanding of them? You know I remember that I put a lot of work in your classes.\u000a\u000aWe plan to go home this Christmas and meet our families. My parents ask me about you all the time. They had the greatest time when they visited me here. \u000a\u000awell that's all for now but I will keep in touch more often. Let me know how thigs are going with you,\u000a\u000asay hi to your wife from me\u000abest wishes,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAs a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests. There is another way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information.\u000a\u000aSecond, I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventory number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit, more in line with the historical average now.\u000a\u000aLet me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYou could probably add expected capacity projections to see how Asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to let's say other areas of the world. I remember that in the RISI conference the speakers were saying that Asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of Latin America but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers.\u000a\u000aAnyways, you can find the capacity expansion data in the PPPC website. Let me know because I have some printed copies too.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aG-P Leaf <NAME/> pulp mill sale deal with <NAME/> falls through\u000a10/24/2001 17:43:03, Forestweb \u000aBy <NAME/> <NAME/>  San <NAME/>, Oct. 24, 2001 (Forestweb) -- The tentative deal for <NAME/>-Pacific Corp. (G-P) to sell its Leaf <NAME/> market pulp mill to <NAME/> Corp. has collapsed, according to a knowledgeable industry source.  Neither company is speaking publicly about the latest development, citing policies against commenting on rumors. However, the pending arrangement, subject to final approval, was no secret to some pulp and paper industry players (see Forestweb, Oct.19).  Top <NAME/> officials were said to have nixed the agreement this week. Last week in its third quarter earnings statement, the company reported a net loss of $618 million, including a write-off of $1.01 billion.  The source said the deal might still be salvageable at a later date.  The Leaf <NAME/> mill, in New <NAME/>, Miss., has the capacity to produce 600,000 tonnes per year. Since February it has produced exclusively softwood kraft pulp.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHello <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was glad to hear back from you. So you are going to be a grandpa soon. That's great news!\u000a\u000aWell, the main reason I am writing to you is that I need some advice. I would like to go back to school next year but I have no financial security. My job prospects don't look good either now that <NAME/> was bought from another company.  I know that many private schools offer scholarships as well as assistantships. I am looking into all of those. \u000a\u000aIt would be very helpful for me if you would help and direct me in the righ direction, let's say if you know a professor that would like to have his own researcher which would help me in the process to go through with school. I have a great deal of interest in finance, and that is what I want to do, I really don't want to do a MBA, rather a MS in Finance. I am very ambitious and work really hard to succeed. I have great work experience and I have worked for a company that is well recognized for its talent pool.\u000a\u000aIf you can't help me with this process, do you know anyone who can? I really would appreciate any advice that you can give me because I have no one else to get advice from right now. In addition, if you have any contact in the job market I would look into that too. \u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact Transwestern if <NAME/> should direct the liquids from their 8" line into the pipeline liquids tank at Wt-1, I have a concern.  \u000a\u000aThe liquids that are generated in the 8" line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations (RCRA) as long as they stay in the <NAME/> line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank.  Because WT-1 is a mainline compressor station, any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank.  Within the past few years, we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at Wt-1 which were not placed there by Tranwestern.  Chemicals which producers and processing, upstream of Wt-1, have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal.  Unfortunately, there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials.\u000a\u000aBased upon this, I would recommend that we not allow Dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRandy, I tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered.  I thought you might have changed your address.  Guess I typed it in by mistake. (age does that to you sometimes).  Yes, things are stressful, but as you eluded to God doesnt give His kids a spirit of fear, but confidence that He is in control.  I never thought I d see the <NAME/> empire tumble, but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough, eventually it gives up and surrenders.  There is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the <NAME/> umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of <NAME/>.  Transwestern is definately a money making asset, and that is what may keep me afloat.  Well see.  Anyway, as long as I keep my focus on <NAME/> and keep reminding myself of that which is important (family and health) I know Ill come through all of this.\u000a\u000aSorry to hear that there is the word "reorganization"  in Hess.  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive.  I hate this kind of stuff. I know that change is inevitable, but so disruptive.  Ill keep you in prayer. Isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough God, that He can handle all our problems?  Keep the faith......my friend and focus on the eternal.  Just like <NAME/> wrote, were just pilgrims in a foregin land, waiting for the trip home and promise of <NAME/>'s return.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.\u000a\u000aThe public hearing was held in <NAME/>, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of this week. \u000a\u000aAttended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.\u000a\u000aAssisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance monitoring report  for C/S No.7.\u000a\u000aA meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last several months.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God hate to see pain hit a family member.  Even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and security knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  When you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill us with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work everything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in your <NAME/> walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities. \u000a\u000aWhen you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.  Sharing <NAME/> with someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations.  In Hebrews were told  to encourage the brethren.  I would consider it an honor to hear form you again....keep the faith...  its all we have.........\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, it seems that the letter we received from <NAME/> is otherwise.   In the process of having the Navajo EPA take over the drinking water program for the Tribe, the EPA as overseer wants to be kept in the loop for a little while longer.  In light of this, we need to not only send to the EPA all monthly sampling reports for drinding, but also to the <NAME/> <NAME/> of the Navanl Nation.  I spoke with <NAME/> about this and he said that the EPAs involvement would start  to deminish in the future but he didnt when.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.\u000a\u000aStations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in <NAME/> AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  <NAME/> is located approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them otherwise (<NAME/>, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.\u000a\u000aStations 3 and 4.  I received a call from <NAME/> Kohn, the permit engineer for the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for station 3 and or 4.\u000a\u000aIll keep everyone apprised of future events.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI know <NAME/> from when he worked for Commissioner Jesse Knight at the California PUC.  It's worth noting that Knight was the lone dissenting voice on the California restructuring fiasco.

Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with "rule of thumb" guidelines)?\u000a\u000aIf we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?\u000a\u000aMy original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAttached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:\u000a\u000aThe employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).\u000aTerminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.\u000aOur "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).\u000aLet us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.\u000a

For what it's worth, I agreed with <NAME/> that to the extent <NAME/> and <NAME/> had reached agreement regarding, among other things, <NAME/>'s use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with <NAME/> that it was not my call to make.\u000a
p3328
aV\u000a\u000aI'm not sure I would give a list of topics (I'd hate to see what would come of the PRC video!).

aV\u000a\u000aWelcome and thanks for contacting me.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.  I'll ask my assistant to get in touch in the next couple of weeks.  Maybe we could have lunch?\u000a\u000aAlso, my wife is working with the <NAME/> of the Rice engineering school on a history of engineering at Rice.  If your wife would like to get to know the engineering community in <NAME/>, we may be able to help out.\u000a
p3331
aV\u000a\u000aI'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).\u000a \u000aIn other news:  <NAME/>'s mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and <NAME/> will be getting a hospice nurse today.  <NAME/> seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when <NAME/> was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  "I don't think we"ll be having sex today."\u000a
p3332
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> had suggested that we try to get Schmalensee (sp?) for the October meeting as a substitute for Joskow.  What do you think?\u000a
p3333
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with <NAME/> Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe <NAME/>, <NAME/> L and <NAME/> are working on):\u000a\u000aAgenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood\u000aA "white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.\u000a\u000aLike most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's "panel" on or about Oct 9.\u000a
p3334
aV\u000a\u000aTracey prepared the attached to make sure we had the facts surrounding another related party (the Travel Agency in the Park).  As you'll see from the attached use of the agency is encouraged (for sound business reasons) but is not mandatory\u000a
p3335
aV\u000a\u000aI see my numbers are going up but still not high enough.  Alot of my people are outside of <NAME/>.  Are they solicited anyway?  When we are finished I would like to see a breakdown between my <NAME/>-based and outside <NAME/> numbers.\u000a
p3336
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> yesterday.  I had also talked to <NAME/> Robertson.  <NAME/> was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told <NAME/> we should wait a bit and he agreed.\u000a\u000aWho else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.\u000a
p3337
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to Skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the Jones School.  I was very clear that I had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet.  He said he would be interested.  If you would like to talk to him, I'll give you his number.\u000a
p3338
aV\u000a\u000aWe have already submitted our budget for PR, Govt' affairs, Facilities, corp HR etc.  Does the process below affect my numbers (please say no).\u000a
p3339
aV\u000a\u000aAt the end of this string is a letter reply to Mr. Krugman's most recent column.  As indicated below, <NAME/> Lay, our Chairman, President and CEO, would be happy to put his name to the letter.  That would be our preference.  Let me know if you need anything more.\u000a
p3340
aV\u000a\u000aFurther to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.\u000a\u000aPlease see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk.\u000a
p3341
aV\u000a\u000aGood update.  Please put me on the distribution list for future installments.\u000aWhat about the net benefits test?  <NAME/> the rate agreement suffice?  call to discuss.\u000a
p3342
aV\u000a\u000aI think we should have a version which says that "ken Lay named ... "  I don't know that the Board actually does the electing, I think <NAME/> may just be making sure that they are OK with his decision.  I will confirm.\u000a
p3343
aV\u000a\u000aI'm sorry ... I told mom, <NAME/> and <NAME/>, but not you... Francis died two weeks ago.  <NAME/> is fine.  She is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us (around Christmas).\u000a
p3344
aV\u000a\u000aLooks good.  In the memo I wouldn't have ken refer to <NAME/> Powers as "<NAME/>"  sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing.\u000a
p3345
aV\u000a\u000aSee below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of <NAME/>' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him.\u000a
p3346
aV\u000a\u000aI think you are the right person to get this.  If not, please let me know as soon as possible.  See reply to Krugman's August 17 column at the end of this email string.  <NAME/> Lay, <NAME/>'s Chairman and CEO is putting his name to the letter and we would prefer that you publish it as such.\u000a
p3347
aV\u000a\u000aWe can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else, but the money to Brown is out the door.\u000aI would still like to see the data.\u000a
p3348
aV\u000a\u000aThank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of "my <NAME/>."  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAttached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and <NAME/> Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that <NAME/> McMahon and <NAME/> Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.\u000a
p3351
aV\u000a\u000aThanks so much; it was a tough week, but I am very proud of how the whole team handled it.  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I worked on the attached and I agree with your assessment, but IR was not pleased.  Hopefully, we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand.  As much as I enjoyed working with <NAME/> and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership, I feel like the whole place is energized by <NAME/>'s obvious competence, calm, and heart.  I have never felt better about working here.\u000a
p3352
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> worked for EES before and came to us highly recommended.  Also know that I won't be talking to <NAME/> until next week.\u000a
p3353
aV\u000a\u000aThanks so much.  As the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking.  I will be in touch when the time comes.\u000a
p3354
aV\u000a\u000aStarting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce <NAME/>'s cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As <NAME/> has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of <NAME/> is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the <NAME/> Industrial Markets and <NAME/> Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these "first mover" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.\u000a
p3355
aV\u000a\u000aI left a message.  <NAME/> has stated publicly that succession will be internal, so we won't be needing these guys.\u000a
p3356
aV\u000a\u000aSome background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:\u000a\u000aBrown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  <NAME/> Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.\u000a<NAME/> has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.\u000aIf you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:\u000aCongratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.\u000aCompliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.\u000a(You should know that the <NAME/> police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the <NAME/> building.)\u000aWe have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.\u000aEES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction\u000aThe city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction\u000aThat would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.\u000aWe have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.\u000aSeparately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.\u000a
p3357
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Horton called about the production tax credit for <NAME/> Wind. (<NAME/> Wind is one of the many companies he's responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved, at least on this issue).  I will forward your latest update (originally to <NAME/> Metts), but I think you should provide a new update for <NAME/> as well as a discussion of what we are doing (or should be doing) to get the extension.\u000a
p3358
aV\u000a\u000aI think it would be useful to get in touch with the HR leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done.  More than anything I want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we aren't doing anything.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000athanks <NAME/>.  It's difficult to see so many smart, hard working people in the kinds of circumstances you describe.  Unfortunately, I'm going through some of the same things (on a smaller scale).  We are having to let people go in my organization.  I simply don't have room, even for a qualified person like <NAME/>.\u000aDoes Global markets still have a presence in Singapore?  If so, perhaps there is an opportunity there.\u000a
p3365
aV\u000a\u000aSee below and look at attachment.  In a subsequent message the comment was made that the drop off today is typical for post bid week activity.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSome additional background on the California refund issue.  Consistent with what we discussed; just some additional detail.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is a suggested Lay quote for the special committee release:\u000a\u000a"With the formation of this special committee and the attraction of additional capital, which we are also announcing today, we are taking care of the past and securing the future."\u000a
p3369
aV\u000a\u000aI need the following changes to Outlook:\u000a\u000a I need my file folders to be "active" so that I can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when I am working offline.\u000aI need my "inbox" to show all my messages, including the large messages -- I don't want to have to check in two places (or more) to review all my new messages.  I also need to be able to access those large messages when I am working offline.\u000a
p3370
aV\u000a\u000aI hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days.  I understand that <NAME/> and <NAME/> have spoken and that <NAME/>, <NAME/>, and <NAME/> will be coming over at 3:00 and no one is expected to be there at 1:00.  Correct?\u000a
p3371
aV\u000a\u000aI know this is not technically an employee relations issue, but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before.  I agree with <NAME/>.  There is little point showing this to <NAME/> ... but you personally know him better, so I leave it to you.\u000a
p3372
aV\u000a\u000aWe should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. \u000a\u000a I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.\u000a
p3373
aV\u000a\u000aWe are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme -- restoring confidence, overcoming adversity etc.  <NAME/> <NAME/> is working with <NAME/> on speakers.  It may be worth discussing at the Management Committee today.\u000a
p3374
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> is still an open question.\u000aI think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy?\u000aI want to show <NAME/> the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount.\u000aI'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past).\u000a
p3375
aV\u000a\u000aThe Board has asked for a draft communications plan.  Attached is an outline.  Obviously, it is a bit premature to finalize the plan, so this presentation just reviews different scenarios.\u000a

My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  \u000a\u000aI also understand, after talking to <NAME/>, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  \u000a\u000aIf there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.\u000a

Everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.  I'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together!  And we need to!  I'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon. So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.  Any chance of you and <NAME/> coming down?  We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welcome.  I love your house!  Thanks for sending the picture.  Its so exciting but its also a lot of work!  I'm glad I'm done!  It's nice to be in the house, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards!  Its very strange, but what to do?  <NAME/>, I can't believe is 3!  And a very terrible 3.  My hands are full!  I'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter.  She quite the daring child, so I think she'll enjoy.  Ask <NAME/> for me if this is too young.  She won't think so, its mostly my fear. =3D)  You'll get a kick of the pictures I've attached.  One of them is my depiction a young <NAME/> <NAME/>. Hopefully you saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!  You'll also notice the Beagle that <NAME/> bought for <NAME/>.  HAHA!

Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.  Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to <NAME/> Fagan by December 28.  As guidelines:\u000a\u000a       1. We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels.\u000a       2.  Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, <NAME/>, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good.\u000a       3.  I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a      All I really wanted to ensure is that we were striving to get as many tickets as we could, since the employees would take as many as we could get.  I was concerned that with all of the cost cutting, someone would just assume that we could get by without the tickets.  I thought that Deb could get eight (8), I'd buy them personally, and I'd use four (Hayes and me), and would give the other four to employees.  If <NAME/> <NAME/> wants four (4), that's fine.  Let Deb know, however, that employees using them for personal use (which I'm sure will be all of them), will be expected to pay for them themselves.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Also, <NAME/>'s numbers do not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after the project was initially developed.  The other thing to keep in mind is that there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.  We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage to capture short term market anomalies).

Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-<NAME/> counterparty.

I am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done, why and when.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a      I've not kept up with <NAME/> for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that <NAME/> worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  <NAME/> really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by <NAME/> and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that <NAME/> and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). \u000a      As for enemies at <NAME/>---I think that they are all gone (<NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> Stokes and crew).  I think that <NAME/> Frevert still thinks highly of <NAME/> and understands that <NAME/> was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the <NAME/> and <NAME/> thing).\u000a      I do know that <NAME/> has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very <NAME/> and has a lot less ego than he once had.  If I could hire him back, I would.  I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.  I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me.\u000a      Let me know if I can help further.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.

We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and <NAME/> would sell for incremental revenue.

aV\u000a\u000aI'm still concerned about the terms "price" and "quotation."  My understanding was that "Worldscale" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices "calculated using the Worldscale Assessments."  Do I have this all wrong?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIt really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in big trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the second floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all gone.\u000a\u000aInterstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the loop) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!

aV\u000a\u000aFYI . . .\u000a\u000aBelow is written by our environmental consultant EEA\u000a\u000a>>\u000aBased on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just \u000areleased, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons \u000abringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This \u000awould mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 \u000afor 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be \u000acalculated right now because they will depend on how many \u000abanked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on \u000athe implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state \u000aand EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are \u000apretty much in that range.\u000a<<\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aBroadband Networking News  <NAME/> Holmes 03/27/2001  <NAME/> Hits Back Quickly After Blockbuster Failure <NAME/>-based energy and communications conglomerate <NAME/>'s <NAME/> Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electronics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electronics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental to <NAME/> 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for <NAME/> after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announced March 9, that would have given <NAME/> exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video-on-demand service.   "The exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on-demand service," explains <NAME/> D. Rice, president and CEO of <NAME/> Broadband Services.  "The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing, but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete," notes <NAME/> Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warburg. "I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving traffic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company, which is what they did."  The failure of the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year agreement could have given <NAME/> significant upside in the content delivery business.   "I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for <NAME/> ," <NAME/> Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tells Broadband Networking News. "I think they will probably [get] one or two anchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic."  The deal with Electronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the importance <NAME/> is placing on securing content for its broadband network. Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is <NAME/> 's core telecom business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into most analysts' forecasts on the company.   "I am confident that the content delivery business will be successful," says <NAME/> Niles, a utilities equity analyst at Salomon Smith <NAME/>. "The fact of the matter is they did get another deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not very successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage."  "The reality is that no one had any earnings (from Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best," Yannello adds. "It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It is disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in."  <NAME/>, which produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various businesses, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbuster deal.   "We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating," Yannello says. "That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $25 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Blockbuster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we expand that $25 telecom valuation."\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRegarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.\u000a\u000aWe have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aP.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two <NAME/> Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial ("A") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.

aV\u000a\u000aFebruary/March 2001 Issue  <NAME/> Unveils Storage Trades <NAME/> Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts were based on <NAME/>'s standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network. <NAME/>'s involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at <NAME/>. "When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham.   The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases. "There is a premium in the price for firm delivery," says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to <NAME/> as a market maker. In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. "most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThis e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and <NAME/> a few weeks ago. \u000a\u000aAttached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.\u000a\u000aAlso, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?  \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Taylor\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI have to agree.  It sounds like a fundamental lack of consideration situation.  If we are the buyer and actually believe there is value here, we should be willing to pay SOME kind of premium, even if it is fairly small.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach <NAME/> Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.\u000a<NAME/> Morrow\u000aArlington, Va.\u000a

The conference will be held in St. <NAME/>, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.\u000a\u000aOne of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.\u000a\u000aI'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  \u000a\u000aAfter you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you.

aV\u000a\u000aHi everyone!!\u000a\u000a	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is <NAME/> Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  \u000a\u000aAttached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.\u000a\u000aOur current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  \u000a\u000aI am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  \u000a\u000aIf possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>--\u000a	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, \u000a\u000aProject cost $911mm\u000aInclude all compression adds/mods from <NAME/> Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01\u000aIncremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San <NAME/>, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border\u000aOf 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau\u000aAssume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.\u000aAssume fuel collection of 5% from shippers\u000a\u000aIn theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.\u000a\u000aIs an answer possible by Tuesday 11/13?\u000a\u000athanks\u000a

You don't hear us gripping about you leaving it down, do\u000a> you?  No, of course not.  That would be stupid, and there are far more\u000a> important things to be worried about.

Asking opinionated questions that you already have an answer to, and\u000a> then getting pissed off because we gave our honest answer in the opposite\u000a> direction is a really stupid thing to do.\u000a>\u000a> 8.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz\u000atogether.\u000a>\u000a> 28.  No, it doesn't matter which quiz.\u000a>\u000a> 29.  Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.\u000a>\u000a> 30.  All comments become null and void after 7 days.\u000a>\u000a> 31.  If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways\u000a> makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.\u000a>\u000a> 32.  Let us ogle (stare). We're going to look anyway: it's genetic, and we\u000a> know you do it too.\u000a>\u000a> 33.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like\u000a> nothing's wrong.

aV\u000a\u000aTW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.\u000a\u000aThe Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  \u000a\u000aPioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .\u000a\u000aTW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:\u000a	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;\u000a	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.\u000a\u000a\u000aItems to Verify:\u000a 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral\u000a 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)\u000a\u000a\u000aOpportunities for TW:\u000aBy Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.\u000a\u000aA lunch has been scheduled with <NAME/> Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.\u000a

Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.\u000a\u000aIs an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?\u000a\u000athanks\u000a

aV\u000a\u000athanks Blair, we've been following the FR debate very closely.\u000a\u000aLast week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contracts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the original 1996 El Paso settlement.

(NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. \u000aBoth KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. \u000aPhase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. \u000aBased in San <NAME/>, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . \u000aKinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.\u000a

If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.  \u000a\u000aLet me know what you think\u000akh\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>--\u000a	per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:\u000a\u000aVolume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d\u000aVolume to Cal Border     -  30,000\u000aSan <NAME/> receipts		 - 780,000\u000a\u000aProjected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu\u000a\u000aWe are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24)\u000aand pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).\u000a\u000aPlease don't hesitate to call me with any questions.\u000a\u000aBest Regards,\u000a
p3663
aV\u000a\u000aspoke with <NAME/> Morgan.  At this point, he only has Mon - Tues 1/14-15 open.  He may have other openings if there are cancellations, we just have to let him know so he can call us.  The rut just started, they've taken some bucks off the place.  If we wanted to hunt an extra day, because we were there before, he would charge $150 per shooter.  If you wanted to bring a 3rd party, price would be the full $500 for a 2 day hunt.\u000a\u000aLet me know what you want to do.  I'm flexible.\u000a
p3664
aV\u000a\u000aI saw this too.  Is this just more stumping by "concerned" politicians in a congressional election year ( I can't remember what party <NAME/> is with).  Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.  I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site.\u000a

(lp3667
V\u000a\u000aI forgot to mention that today's curves will be down another 5%, therefore, the prices in the spreadsheet are too high.\u000a
p3668
aV\u000a\u000aYour summary is accurate.   I appreciate you and <NAME/> coming to <NAME/> for the de-briefing and we look forward to extending our exclusive relationship.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3669
aV\u000a\u000aI would recommend sitting with the real-time traders (they trade, reserve transmission and schedule the power in real-time).   You can coordinate with me.\u000a
p3670
aV\u000a\u000aNo development is easy.   I see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome.   Please develop a plan to have a 150 MW on-line my May 02 with rented diesel equipment.   We would install the diesels at OPPD distribution substations.   We may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result.\u000a\u000aLast year Com-<NAME/> and IPL completed an installation with CATs in 3 months.   The key is to get OPPD to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses.\u000a\u000aPlease work with <NAME/> and <NAME/>.   If you need any additional info after working through a plan with <NAME/> and <NAME/>, please let me know.\u000a
p3671
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Dorbone (sp?).   You can get his phone # on Gleannochfarms.com web site.   They have 4 custom builders (<NAME/> Bailey, Pine Oak, Country Village, and <NAME/> Hale).   They recently fired Coventry and <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aI have not made a decision yet, but I am considering Gleannloch as an alternative.   It would be a big positive for me if you could build the house.\u000a
p3672
aV\u000a\u000aThe first report looked good, however, I would like to see the owner name, and technical configuration.   In addition, I would like pictures of each facility.\u000a
p3673
aV\u000a\u000aFriday is a terrible day for tours in power.   My entire desk leaves at 2:00 pm on Friday.\u000a\u000aI would suggest the gas floor for this tour.   The customer will be very unimpressed if we have limited staff here in the middle of the day.\u000a
p3674
aV\u000a\u000aFor 01 and 02, congestion/energy uplift/transmission uplift is $3.50 to $4.50/Mwh.   Current EES curves are light in this area.\u000a\u000aFor 03 & beyond when LMP is adopted in NE ISO and socialized allocation is eliminated, the congestion component alone in the Boston area will be well over $10/Mwh (based on actual congestion $'s from May 99 to date in the Boston area).\u000a\u000aMuch like the Dallas situation, these locational congestion charges can be significant and <NAME/> and <NAME/> will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now.\u000a\u000aI hope this helps.\u000a
p3675
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and I are dividing up <NAME/> postions (<NAME/> taking Peak, I'm taking Off-Peak).   To make it fair on everyone, I am allowing <NAME/> to take $4 million from Prudency C attached to JEA.  (<NAME/> has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in FL & SOCO).\u000a\u000aIn addition, I will be assuming all customer deals (VEPCO, JEA, Associated, MPMUC).\u000a\u000aWe will mark the curves in Entergy and TVA where <NAME/> is comfortable taking the position (off-peak also needs to be marked down).  The $4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift.   All of <NAME/> postions will stay in Wholesale.\u000a\u000aAll parties come out with a fair solution.\u000a
p3676
aV\u000a\u000aSounds good.   We may want to consider diesel installation for <NAME/> Electric as well.\u000a\u000aI am beginning to think that diesel installations is our primary solution to cover OPPD short for May-Oct 02.\u000a
p3677
aV\u000a\u000aICAP exposure needs to be capped at the default price (currently 8.75/kW/mo).   Because Zone J is deficient capacity, the market is actually trading higher than the default rate.\u000a\u000aIn addition, we need to scrub the ancillary components.\u000a
p3678
aV\u000a\u000aI think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.\u000a
p3679
aV\u000a\u000aWe have this already by comparing daily reports.   I simply look at the change in daily postions.   Both Lavo and I are OK with the current reports.\u000a
p3680
aV\u000a\u000aWe need to add <NAME/> <NAME/> and 4-5 people with T&D tariff knowledge to the curve team as well.   This process will entail specific wholesale curves plus a complete review of the T&D tariff curves.\u000a\u000aThese teams need to work together to ensure the sum of the parts equal the whole.   I am assuming everyone on the team agrees.\u000a
p3681
aV\u000a\u000aThis is the spread option which I am able to reconcile.   The big P&L discrepancy is on the pure TVE fixed price positions which are off by $1 million+.   Please continue to reconcile with <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3682
aV\u000a\u000aIs this going to get done?   My sense is this would reduces energy uplift charges and reduce energy clearing prices.   Do you agree?\u000a
p3683
aV\u000a\u000aAs I told <NAME/> this morning, we have similar issues with Var in the East.   The correlations between gas & power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month.\u000a\u000aI have requested changes to the Var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon.\u000a
p3684
aV\u000a\u000aGood info on new plants.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - Can we get this spreadsheet on our website under fundies tab.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3685
aV\u000a\u000aWe have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.\u000a\u000aI would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3686
aV\u000a\u000aWe have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor.   I think its important to put all power related retail functions (risk management, tariffs, structuring, risk reporting, etc.) on the 5th floor.\u000a\u000aIf you do this, then there will not be room for the retail gas group, which means you need to work with <NAME/> Shephard and <NAME/> Colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas.\u000a
p3687
aV\u000a\u000aJoe is set to rotate to real-time MW on June 1 and <NAME/> Rust is taking his scheduling place.   I have no problem with Joe going with you.   With respect to Narsima, timing may be an issue (transition), however, I should be able to make that happen as well.\u000a\u000aWith Busby, <NAME/>, Joe and Narsima (timing an issue), you have some competent support at the outset   In addition, there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline.\u000a\u000aHopefully, the dust settles and the transition can start next Monday.   We also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions.\u000a
p3688
aV\u000a\u000aI didn't receive any home information.   I'm interested in resale homes, new homes and lots.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3689
aV\u000a\u000aI'm not in the business of providing firm pricing via e-mail.   As always, all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger.   As a rule of thumb, prices are good for about 15 minutes.\u000a\u000aTherefore, let's be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 5-10% on some days.   For example, summer power is down $20.00/Mwh over the past week and June is down $10/Mwh.   <NAME/> 02 and summer 03 are down $7-8/Mwh over the past 3 days.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3690
aV\u000a\u000aPlease begin working on filling our Associated short position in 02.   I would like to take this risk off the books.\u000a\u000aIn addition, please find out what a buy-out of VEPCO would cost us.   With <NAME/> transitioning to run our retail risk management, I would like to clean up our customer positions.\u000a\u000aWe also need to continue to explore a JEA buy-out.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3691
aV\u000a\u000aWe would like to hire <NAME/> Phillips from Koch.   <NAME/>, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).\u000a\u000aThis guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.\u000a
p3692
aV\u000a\u000aAfter talking with <NAME/>, it sounds like a conference call at 1:00 pm tommorow would be more productive.   <NAME/> and <NAME/> are still working through logistics of the move to the 6th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues.\u000a\u000aDoes 1:00 pm tommorow work for you?   We can call you from my office.\u000a
p3693
aV\u000a\u000aYes, I agree.   Remember, <NAME/> has asked to go through a deal and this is a significant transaction.   I suggest going through the deal over lunch.\u000a
p3694
aV\u000a\u000aGround pictures from various angles will do.   My expectation is that I will continue to get weekly updates and the booklet I described will contain the info I requested in an organized manner.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3695
aV\u000a\u000aRemember our deal.   After trading day is over (for next 2 months), you stay until the risk calcs are done and help in whatever manner is necessary to improve the process.   In addition, you should take responsibility for calcing the ERCOT books (term and cash).\u000a
p3696
aV\u000a\u000aSounds good.   I think we will significant synergy benefits immediately.   The cultural barriers will be broken down and information will flow from wholesale to retail and vice versa.\u000a
p3697
aV\u000a\u000aI already read this article.   Price action is wicked bearish on our stock right now.   Fortunately, I have been doing a good bit of hedging my long <NAME/> position.\u000a
p3698
aV\u000a\u000aSounds interesting.  Clearly, we would pay a some premium on the front end for the Boston location.   Work directly with Dana on the specifics.\u000a
p3699
aV\u000a\u000aIf you don't get a response from <NAME/>, just call her or walk up to the legal floor.   On something as important as this, I would go directly to <NAME/>'s office.\u000a
p3700
aV\u000a\u000aHave you spoke to <NAME/> Whalley about <NAME/> Albrecht, Dierdra McCaffery, <NAME/> Brysch, and <NAME/> Kendall.   We need to move forward on putting these teams together, and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to re-build the retail risk management organization over the next 6-9 months.\u000a\u000aI would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3701
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> should be an Associate trading track position.   I forgot to clarify with <NAME/> on original offer.   Remember, we have to go through <NAME/> Johnson at <NAME/> Energy. \u000a\u000aI would like to get the offer letter out today.\u000a
p3702
aV\u000a\u000aI submitted my request to <NAME/> Melodick approx. 1 week ago.   \u000a\u000a<NAME/> - Please make sure Lavo and <NAME/> have my wish list for Analyst and Associate candidates.\u000a
p3703
aV\u000a\u000aI think I could make a case for decreasing ECP, because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ECP (must run units for 6 hours etc.).   I would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at $100/Mwh.   This forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch.\u000a\u000aWe have seen what the additional peakers in the East does to volatility and energy clearing prices, in general.\u000a\u000aWhat are your thoughts?\u000a
p3704
aV\u000a\u000aThe only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply (pet coke, PRB, other, etc.) for $1.00-1.15/MMBtu delivered to the site.   The economics need to show a 8-10% IRR in order to justify the commodity risk.\u000a\u000aIn addition, we should explore IGCC in Florida.   The gas/coal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better.\u000a
p3705
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> will do a fine job with this group presentation.   I think it is important that <NAME/> builds credibility with the marketing organization.\u000a\u000aI'm sure you are OK with this.\u000a
p3706
aV\u000a\u000aWhen do the guys that signed contracts get the paperwork for option grants and restricted stock?   They are all asking me.\u000a
p3707
aV\u000a\u000aThe MTM amount needs to be gross margin, not revenues.   What deal was done for summer Cinergy on Friday?   Did <NAME/> sign off on all of the BECO deals?\u000a
p3708
aV\u000a\u000aI had to leave early yesterday so I am just getting around to reviewing.   Looks good.   I will call with any comments.\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.\u000a
p3709
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>, <NAME/> Hernandez and <NAME/> Baughman (plus Kayne Coulter) should be the East Power reps at this meeting.\u000a
p3710
aV\u000a\u000aI talked with <NAME/> Hickerson and I am OK with granting <NAME/> Cisneros access for her specific valuation purpose (pricing access is for 2 years only).\u000a
p3711
aV\u000a\u000aGreat trading asset, but fixed costs are enormous.   The entire value proposition is based upon $15/Mwh spread between peak and off-peak (which is clearly there today).    My view is this spread collapses over time due to DSM/DG/real-time pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based markets.\u000a\u000aWe should look at the asset, but recognize the fixed costs are huge.\u000a
p3712
aV\u000a\u000aYes it is irrelevant.   Now that we have competent risk managers making the decision, they will know how to effectively hedge these deals.   Furthermore, pricing is always available on demand.   When each trader has 30-40 products to manage in a volatile market, they are not necessarily going to put 03-10 for peak and off-peak in every region.\u000a\u000aIt becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently.\u000a
p3713
aV\u000a\u000aYes, you are correct.   <NAME/> is making the changes I requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before I get a final plan.\u000a\u000aWith respect to your latest Contract, I have 2 minor changes.  The only one with any significance is the counterparty name.   I expect <NAME/>-Carroll Custom Homes to be the signator to this Agreement.   Having a "shell" LLC entiity sign the Contract would be like me having my step-son sign the Contract.\u000a\u000aI want the "real" balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations, much like you want my personal balance sheet/income statement to be the responsible financial counterparty.\u000a\u000aThe other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon.\u000a
p3714
aV\u000a\u000aYour perception is correct.   Remember 4 years of culture is at work here.   I told <NAME/> this morning, we have to move to 35, clearly define the process for pricing deals, and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value.\u000a\u000aThe whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than I originally thought.\u000a
p3715
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to acknowledge <NAME/> Portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   <NAME/> worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions.\u000a\u000aIn addition to Green Mountain, <NAME/> has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other Texas transactions (San <NAME/>, misc. QSE contracts, etc.)\u000a
p3716
aV\u000a\u000aSounds like you are on the team.   I am assuming you will start full-time on Monday.   Whalley has already assured me you will be part of this re-build process which obviously requires full-time focus.\u000a\u000aPlease confirm.\u000a
p3717
aV\u000a\u000aI would say 2,000,000 for Lavo approval.   Whether than signature, I would go through deal specifics and get verbal approval.\u000a

p3723
aV\u000a\u000aI want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.\u000a \u000aI think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.\u000a \u000aI would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.\u000a \u000aDoes everyone agree?\u000a
p3724
aV\u000a\u000aPlease make a recommendation that keeps this individual.   I have given my views, and they are falling on deaf ears.   Please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 75-80k.   This seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult.\u000a
p3725
aV\u000a\u000aThese are not good fills.   When I gave the order DIS was trading at 21.87 (21.86 at 21.88).   I can understand 2-3 cents but not 9 cents.\u000a
p3726
aV\u000a\u000aAre you a mind reader.   I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm (EB641) to go through East Positions (wholesale & T&D) and discuss process, deal review, big risk items, new deals, etc.  In attendance will be:\u000a\u000a	<NAME/>\u000a	<NAME/>\u000a	<NAME/> Black\u000a	<NAME/> Herndon\u000a	<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a	Joe Wagner\u000a	Narsima Misra\u000a	Jubran Whalan\u000a\u000aI recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon).

p3729
aV\u000a\u000aI think you forgot the cash postion.  I would rather have on-line valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.   I like to look at my personal equity portfolio (includes <NAME/> hedging) separate from <NAME/> granted stock and option value.   \u000a\u000aOne portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe attached document should complement the documents sent earlier by <NAME/> Calger.   Hopefully, the combination of the two will provide some organization and focus at our 9:30 am meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the "NETCO" Start-up initiatives.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks.   Any assignment would have to be confidential.   I don't view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer.   If there is a positive NPV trade, we should do it.   "Assignment" maybe the wrong word.   Maybe we can transfer the ERCOT switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am locking up all of the hourly leads and having a discussion with them regarding there top performers and contract status this week.   It is becoming increasingly difficult to put non-managers under contract, so that is my challenge for the hourly group.   Having said that, I concur with your suggestions.\u000a\u000aI am assuming you are presenting Narsima and <NAME/> there promotion and contract packages.   Please confirm.\u000a
p3743
aV\u000a\u000aSeveral names in my Lotus Address Book that did not transfer to the new Outlook platform.   The names that did not transfer have text next to them.   For exampe, <NAME/> Rice did not transfer and his name on Lotus Notes has "Office Number" next to it.\u000a\u000aThere are several other examples of this.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3744
aV\u000a\u000aThank you very much for the nice gift (and, of course, the $1).   I appreciate you girls putting up with me and doing a great job for the whole floor.\u000a\u000aThanks again.\u000a
p3745
aV\u000a\u000aI would like ASAP (by new building) a huge wall map with the logical RTO boundaries that has all of the large generators and substations (nodes in LMP) and LSE's territory color coded.\u000a\u000aThis will become the tour location with a description of the regional markets and the energy hubs within those super regions.   It will also help our traders get accustomed to electrically significant areas whether than NERC regions.\u000a
p3746
aV\u000a\u000aI am interested in lakefront property on Lake <NAME/> which is within 3 hour drive of <NAME/>.   Given the technology sector meltdown, I am looking to "bottom fish" for lakefront property that provides great long term real estate value.\u000a\u000aPlease feel free to e-mail me with "value" opportunities that come up.   I did not find your CD-ROM user friendly and I prefer e-mails with attached property listings that meet my requirements.   I am looking to spend 200-250k for lakefront property that has previously sold in the 275-325k range.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3747
aV\u000a\u000aCalpine is in complete disarray right now, and the entire future of their company hinges on CA honoring their long term above market contracts.   Calpine's non-CA portfolio is getting killed and I don't think they have hedged effectively in the non-CA locations.\u000a\u000aGiven these circumstances, the word "below market" is an "f" word, particulary with the legal concerns they also have.   I would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at Dighton, particularly with the legal issues.\u000a
p3748
aV\u000a\u000aChemistry is very important to me and I am rewarding <NAME/> for his loyalty and "low maintenance".   In addition, he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 6 months of last year.   <NAME/> (working for <NAME/>) is very capable and will do a great job for us in the SE.    <NAME/> Saibi will come over from ERCOT and run the cash books in the SE.\u000a \u000aI will be happy to talk Marcello to see if there is another fit.    With respect to the NE, I also want to move some of the young guys up - they have worked hard for the past 12-18 months in real-time and fundies roles and deserve a chance before an outside person.\u000a
p3749
aV\u000a\u000aPortfolio looks good.   Is it valuing options properly?   Can you rename the portfolio "<NAME/>"\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3750
aV\u000a\u000aI apologize for my earlier comments.   Everyone is having a rough time with the current meltdown of the company.   I have been here 7 years and I am seeing everything I worked for coming to an end.\u000a\u000aIt's not your fault and I do apologize.\u000a
p3751
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> works for <NAME/> North America Wholesale Services (he is Vice President in West Power over hourly trading, middle marketing, and services business).\u000a\u000aYou got em.\u000a
p3752
aV\u000a\u000aI will do <NAME/> and <NAME/>.   I am having <NAME/> do all of his SE hourly group.   With respect to Forney, I will either do myself or have <NAME/> do it.\u000a
p3753
aV\u000a\u000aRidiculous.   I have been forwarding all of your e-mails today to Lavo and <NAME/>.   I am trying to build a case to get Ader and Bernstien (<NAME/> and <NAME/> are my new nicknames) re-assigned and away from our supply business.\u000a
p3754
aV\u000a\u000aThis list is wrong.   Can you reconcile our headcount by functional group with this "incorrect" headcount.\u000a
p3755
aV\u000a\u000aGas or Power?    Gas is <NAME/> <NAME/> and Power is <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith for ERCOT (TX) and <NAME/> Sturm for LA/AL (Gulf Coast).\u000a\u000aThe <NAME/> energy traders know these folks so these questions must be coming from non-commodity people at <NAME/>.\u000a
p3756
aV\u000a\u000aWith respect to East Power markets, I would like a fixed monthly premium in addition to the wider bid/offer in return for Refco's access to our markets.\u000a
p3757
aV\u000a\u000aWe will not be trading on Thanksgiving.   However, we will have a skeleton crew in here on Friday.   I proposed calcing P&L on Wednesday and not on Friday.\u000a
p3758
aV\u000a\u000aWhy can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio).   AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without real-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time energy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio.\u000a\u000aCan we use their own testimony against them?\u000a
p3759
aV\u000a\u000aCould you please create an org chart by function (retained employees) and org chart by function (severed employees) so we can reconcile to make sure we have not missed anyone.\u000a\u000aOnce we have done this, we can create a seating plan that is optimal.   Please e-mail me the org. charts so I have an electronic version.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aEPMI purchased 225 MW of Calender 03 NEPOOL ICAP (Installed Capability) from Calpine at $1.35/kW/Mo.   The parties agreed via a recorded phone conversation (<NAME/> Posoli and <NAME/> Presto) that the LCRA lawsuit would be dropped and neither party would have any further obligations with respect to that lawsuit.\u000a\u000aThe parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language, at which time the ICAP transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you need anything else.\u000a
p3761
aV\u000a\u000aI agree.   We don't know the base value of the current deal, so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring.\u000a
p3762
aV\u000a\u000aPer Lavo, he would like to see ASAP the break-even price on the reg-switch options where length was booked and when wholesale goes below tariff, we can cover and re-create free option.\u000a\u000aWhen can we have summary valuation of this done for East positions?\u000a
p3763
aV\u000a\u000aPlease send an e-mail to "Experience <NAME/>" and let them know the tours need to be conducted as far away from the trading floor as possible and limited to no longer than 5 minutes.   I don't want any of our screens visible to the customers, not matter who they are.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3764
aV\u000a\u000aI need to leave at 3:30 today to go to my stepson's football game.   Unfortunately, I have a 2:00 and 3:00 meeting already.   Is this just a general catch-up discussion?\u000a
p3765
aV\u000a\u000aI used to get an e-mail every day with the component var.   I would like to start receiving this again.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe following people will be making the trip:\u000a\u000aPortland			<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/> Belden			<NAME/> Presto\u000a<NAME/> Swerbzin			<NAME/> Sturm\u000a<NAME/> Badeer			Dana <NAME/>\u000a<NAME/> Richter			<NAME/> Benson\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>			<NAME/> Herndon\u000a<NAME/> Motley			<NAME/> Black\u000a<NAME/> Fisher\u000a<NAME/> Zufferli\u000a\u000aCould you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and <NAME/> Belden.   We may have to arrange for <NAME/> Black and <NAME/> Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon.   Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let <NAME/> and <NAME/> know.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3767
aV\u000a\u000aAbsolutely.   Please call <NAME/> <NAME/> to get access to our new intranet site which has an unbelievable amount of data on historical prices, loads, new gen, HDD's, CDD's, outages, etc.\u000a\u000aOur new fundies group is 100% better in terms of data quality and presentation.\u000a
p3768
aV\u000a\u000aCan he come over to our trading floor around 11:00 am?   I can give him a quick tour and then give him a macro overview of the NA energy markets.   Please confirm via e-mail and directly with my asst. (TJ Black at 713-853-5800).\u000a \u000aThanks.\u000a
p3769
aV\u000a\u000aPlease make the following revisions to the peak and off-peak position reports:\u000a\u000aRemove ERCOT wind position completely from the report (PPA has been terminated)\u000aAdd ERCOT north zone positions\u000aAdd ERCOT south zone positions\u000aShow separate positions for FL/GA border and FPL/FRCC\u000aAdd PJM-East positions (show separate from PJM-West)\u000aOff-Peak position still shows SERC-FL (this location no longer exists) - Florida positions are either FL/GA or FPL/FRCC.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3770
aV\u000a\u000aThe hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  \u000aI will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.\u000a\u000aPlease clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.\u000a
p3771
aV\u000a\u000aSounds like you are as busy as I am.   Yes, my parents still live in the same house in Kennewick.   My Dad retired from teaching in WA (collecting WA retirement) and has been teaching in Hermiston, OR for the last 7 years.\u000a\u000aJust to clarify, <NAME/>'s international business model and North American business model are quite different.   I work in the <NAME/> North American business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the US.   <NAME/> NA's focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas, power, crude, pulp & paper, metals, etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function.   We are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s international business model, on the other hand, entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing (with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities).   This model is OK provided the business risk, currency risk, international risk, change in law risk, legal risk, etc. is priced properly by the debt and equity providers.\u000a\u000aI will let you conclude which business model is better.   I think you will see <NAME/> applying our successful NA model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a "free-market" model.\u000a\u000aLater.\u000a
p3772
aV\u000a\u000aFull access of the complete portal should be limited to core contract employees only.   We have a scaled down version that we have made available to the marketing group.\u000a
p3773
aV\u000a\u000aGood info.   Consistent with reports from McGowan.   I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.   Love the spread given my view of natty.\u000a\u000aSince the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call <NAME/>.   You are certainly free to call him if you want.\u000a
p3774
aV\u000a\u000aYou are 100% correct.  That is my impression as well, and that is why I set up the Monday meeting.  Going forward, the format of those meetings should be:\u000a\u000a	1) Richter presents his area of accountability (West wholesale prosition, risk systems, deal capture system, status of 	projects, schedule, etc.)\u000a	2) Black presents his area of accountability (deal review, west tariff,  and gas)\u000a	3) Herndon presents his area of accountability (East wholesale & East tariffs)\u000a	4) <NAME/> presents his area of accountability (deal structuring, deal valuation, new model construction)\u000a	5) Busby presents his area of accountability (risk systems and portfolio valuation - works with Richter)\u000a	6) You and I find the holes and provide direction.\u000a\u000aYour thoughts?\u000a
p3775
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Nicolay and <NAME/> Novosel are the two best regulatory people.   In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of <NAME/> and <NAME/> combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.\u000a\u000aYou are not off base with Steffes at all.\u000a
p3776
aV\u000a\u000aPlease print and put in binder for me.   Please combine the document from yesterday in the same binder so I can read the whole package while I'm on vacation.\u000a \u000aThanks.\u000a
p3777
aV\u000a\u000aRight now, all of our trades are fixed price at a specific hub.   We will be moving to basis markets in some locations in the very near future.\u000a
p3778
aV\u000a\u000aYou are right.   They are on crack.   This would be at least $3.50/Mwh over Cin.   They have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is No. 2 oil.   Therefore, CPL East is a big premium Nov-Mar.   The bid/offer for this location is large due to transmission risk.\u000a
p3779
aV\u000a\u000aFor the 25th presentation, I need the following:\u000a\u000aA pictorial description of power generation sources:	1) Nuclear\u000a							2) Coal\u000a							3) Resid Steam Unit\u000a							3) Gas Combined Cycle\u000a							4) Gas Simple Cycle\u000a							5) Hydro\u000a\u000aI would like to show annual demand by customer segment (residential, commercial, industrial) for the East, West, and ERCOT and supply by generation type for the same major areas.   A table which shows Mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful.   In addition, total capability by supply source\u000a\u000aSome of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton.\u000a
p3780
aV\u000a\u000aGood luck <NAME/>.   I appreciate your praise and wish you success in your future professional endeavors.\u000a
p3781
aV\u000a\u000aI have done multiple trades today and I also did several last week.   Please clean up my Holdings page to net longs and shorts.   How is your office reacting to the news about UBS acquiring our energy trading operation?\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3782
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - <NAME/>'t worry about the formatting.   After playing around some more, I have a new way that works fine for me.    The main issue is keeping the database live with all of the historical information.    We can figure out how to format.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3783
aV\u000a\u000aWe need an immediate legal review to see what are on-going $ risks are in ERCOT.   The deficiency of $6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of the QSE's on a pro-rata basis, however what if the deficiency is $100 million and we our pro-rata share is $3 million?\u000a\u000aDo we have any legal recourse?   Do they suspend the deficient QSE immediately?\u000a
p3784
aV\u000a\u000aWe would prefer physical rights that we can take day-ahead and/or real-time (5 minutes ahead, if possible).   Rather than an obligation (like FTR's), we prefer an option (spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised).\u000a \u000aI would want to condition the transaction on having one RTO in the NE with LMP pricing in effect for the entirie NE market on or before 1/1/2003.   Assuming we get over those hurdles, this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally (fixed cost structure), therefore, we need to earn a minimum of 25% expected return (after credit).\u000a \u000aObviously, there is a huge unknown on the CT vs. Long Island forward curve with the changing market conditions.   This makes pricing this deal extremely difficult, particulary with the returns we would need to show.\u000a \u000aCall me with any additional questions.\u000a
p3785
aV\u000a\u000aI talked with <NAME/> today and he wanted me to remind you about the e-mail you voluntered to write regarding the transition of site profile accountability back to EES.   If you recall, we decided on a 2-3 month transition with some sort of drop dead accountability for all P&L risks associated with the site profile/DSM positions.\u000a\u000aDo you remember this?  If so, <NAME/> and I did not receive the e-mail.\u000a
p3786
aV\u000a\u000aYou have the latitude to put your key people under contract.   <NAME/> was very clear when I talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers.\u000a
p3787
aV\u000a\u000aI think I can get <NAME/> <NAME/> done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already Director level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to <NAME/>.   Please talk to <NAME/> directly on the justification.\u000a
p3788
aV\u000a\u000aPlease use the next week to clean up our database of delivery locations and regions currently still in Enpower.   I would like to start the database clean with only the key hubs listed:\u000a\u000aNEPOOL PTF\u000aNY Zone J\u000aNY Zone G\u000aNY Zone A\u000a<NAME/>\u000aPJM East Hub\u000aPJM West Hub\u000aPJM West\u000a<NAME/>\u000aCom-<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000aERCOT South (FP)\u000aERCOT North (Basis)\u000a\u000aLet's use this opportunity to clean up Enpower and start with a truly clean set of books.  \u000aTeam - Am I missing anthing?\u000a
p3789
aV\u000a\u000aYou have the right <NAME/> Presto.   I have been employed at <NAME/> now for almost 7 years.   I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US.    Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and <NAME/>'s culture in general.\u000a\u000aHow are you doing?   I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years.   I think the last time I saw you was at <NAME/> Bayless' wedding (85-86?) if my memory is correct.\u000a\u000aWhere is your job located and what work have you done with <NAME/>?\u000a
p3790
aV\u000a\u000aThis transaction was never in the trading books and all P&L and decision-making was within the origination group.   I may have recommended that Ozzie buy the balance of year coal, however, all $ impacts and decisions were within the control of orig/corp development.\u000a\u000aTherefore, <NAME/>, Ozzie and <NAME/> Miller are the parties that must deal with any of the contractual issues and intra-company monetary issues.\u000a
p3791
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization.   My understanding is that Delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year.   Please confirm with <NAME/>.\u000a
p3792
aV\u000a\u000aLooks like Ader & Co. at work in ERCOT.   I view this as a big problem.   These customers need to be covered by wholesale.   Both of you should take this as a slap in the face.\u000a
p3793
aV\u000a\u000aI have book positions in the NE market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets.    NEPOOL came off very hard today ($2.00/Mwh through 2006) while the NY markets were off only $0.50 - $1.00/Mwh.   I am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and I don't see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading.\u000a\u000aAgain - I will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3794
aV\u000a\u000aPlease net longs and shorts for DIA and DYN.   I will do almost all trades on-line, therefore, I would like some mechanism to make all trades net on the Holdings page.\u000a
p3795
aV\u000a\u000aAll fixed price locations (ERCOT, Ent, Cin, TVA, SOCO, Com-<NAME/>, PJM, NEPOOL, etc.).   The biggest Cal positions are Cin, Ent, PJM, and NEPOOL.\u000a
p3796
aV\u000a\u000aOne group needs to mark curves.   I personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region.   I simply need to make it a priority again.   I can go either way, though.   We definitely don't want two sets of curves.\u000a\u000aLet me know.\u000a
p3797
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> International purchased all of Com-<NAME/>'s gas and coal plants approx. 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to Com-<NAME/> through 2004.\u000a\u000aThe operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found.   I would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback.\u000a
p3798
aV\u000a\u000aI concur with <NAME/> on approach with one clarification.   Transmission providers discussions should include both a trading rep and marketing rep.\u000a
p3799
aV\u000a\u000aOur marks are fine (at least through 04 where we occasionally see #'s).   I don't think it's appropriate to shut down anything.  We need to price the product properly and off-peak needs just as much margin as on-peak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth.\u000a\u000aRather than shut down products, increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market.   We are chipping away at our off-peak position day by day and we have bought some NYMEX coal.\u000a\u000aAm I making sense?   In addition, I am working with <NAME/> to buy 7x24 from FPL in North Texas (for both desks).   We will probably have to pay $3.50-4.00 spread to get 3-5 year 7x24 deal done.\u000a\u000aWith respect to NE, the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for off-peak, therefore, in some ways the risk is easier to manage.\u000a
p3800
aV\u000a\u000aHow come you never show EOL #'s for East Power.   I would like to see East Power included in the e-mail report.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3801
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> indicated that credit has agreed to allow credit-worthy counterparties to trade through 2004.   The following are the counterparties East Power would like to have 04 access on EOL.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000aBP Energy\u000a<NAME/>\u000aMorgan <NAME/>\u000aEl Paso\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/> Lynch\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPlease let me know ASAP who gets approved and when EOL will grant trading rights.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3802
aV\u000a\u000aThe ESCA energy management system (EMS) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards.   We used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party "outsourcing/services" deals in ERCOT and SPP.\u000a \u000aI hope this helps.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe are losing lots of deals in ERCOT on price.  This is part of the reason they are being so aggressive with customers and alternative suppliers.   I have received this feedback directly from <NAME/> and <NAME/>.\u000a
p3804
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year.   It was by far the best regulatory effort (from a power perspective) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at <NAME/>.   You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together, we will reap the benefits for years to come.\u000a
p3805
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/>, Suarez, Gupta, <NAME/>, Schiavone, Misra, Wang, and Ballato also need to be able to trade gas (or there equivalent trading books need to be able to trade gas if the above names change).\u000a
p3806
aV\u000a\u000aThe only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop.\u000a\u000aI don't know what caused this, but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run.   In addition, the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow.   Is this normal?\u000a\u000aAny thoughts?\u000a\u000aThanks for all your work - the printer works just fine\u000a
p3807
aV\u000a\u000aI think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and myself.   I think <NAME/> would be more successful in a freelance role.\u000a\u000aOther input?\u000a
p3808
aV\u000a\u000aThe same attachment was sent again in case you had trouble opening the previous file.   I am sending from home via the network and have been having some problems.   Sorry to e-mail you to death.\u000a
p3809
aV\u000a\u000aThe average guy has no idea what is coming.   T&D costs are going to explode and so is wholesale power (increased O&M, security, employees, capital improvements, risk premium, etc.)\u000a
p3810
aV\u000a\u000aPlease put on calender and remind all desk heads to invite people who have signed up.   This includes you, <NAME/>, and <NAME/>.\u000a
p3811
aV\u000a\u000aPlease proceed with <NAME/> on taking the prudency you are comfortable with.   <NAME/> will have to get approval from <NAME/> and/or Lavo.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3812
aV\u000a\u000aWhat do you need from me?   Do you want me to meet with him?  talk to him on the phone?   go to lunch?    is he looking for a job?    As you can see, I don't have much information of the objective here.\u000a
p3813
aV\u000a\u000aObviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.   My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.   No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.\u000a\u000aI will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow.\u000a
p3814
aV\u000a\u000aWe have some serious issues.   Downgrade, collateral called, liquidity crisis, issue more equity.   I can see $12 pretty easy.\u000a\u000aI think both Lay and Fastow are gone.\u000a
p3815
aV\u000a\u000aAs I discussed with Joe Deffner, the <NAME/> transaction we recently completed (loan in a commodity deal), we were unable to get the "exception language" for collateral.   We did the transaction at LIBOR - 10bp and even when we add 65-75 bp for the cost of an LC, the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash.\u000a\u000aThe confirms we sent incorrectly placed the "exception language" and I am correcting that today.\u000a
p3816
aV\u000a\u000aPlease put <NAME/> <NAME/> Contact information (get from <NAME/>) in My Outlook contacts - home, cell, work, address, etc. and put a reminder on my calender to call him to re-establish contract relationship.\u000a \u000aAlso, please put a reminder to call <NAME/> Giffels regarding consulting agreement and FPL.\u000a
p3817
aV\u000a\u000aNotice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less.   Additionally, if we use them as sink when we go hourly, they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag.   If these issues are not crystal clear with them, I have no interest in even showing an offer.\u000a
p3818
aV\u000a\u000aAbsolutely.   I may have to smooth over the <NAME/> Mehn issue (<NAME/> committed to go to wholesale structuring)\u000a
p3819
aV\u000a\u000aThey are pursuing because I requested to pursue.   The reason for the e-mail is to place management emphasis on this opportunity.\u000a
p3820
aV\u000a\u000aYes we need PRB 8400 and PRB 8800 curves.   My agreement with EGM was coal curves in exchange for power curves.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - If I don't get the PRB coal curves by the end of this week, I will have to remove access to our power curves.\u000a
p3821
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aThis looks good.   You have my blessing to proceed with approval from the cash committee.   You can reach me at home (713-856-7483) if you have any additional questions.\u000a \u000aThanks.\u000a
p3822
aV\u000a\u000aThe meeting has been moved to tommorow at 11:00 am.   We can discuss these issues before the meeting.\u000a
p3823
aV\u000a\u000aI talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.\u000a\u000aI am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:\u000a\u000a	1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required)\u000a	2) Plane picks up <NAME/> guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (<NAME/> time)\u000a	3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.\u000a	4) Plane returns to <NAME/> 6:00 pm Sunday\u000a	5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)\u000a\u000aLet me know if this works for you guys.\u000a
p3824
aV\u000a\u000aI view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore.   The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.\u000a\u000aI can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate.   I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate.   I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well.   One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area.\u000a
p3825
aV\u000a\u000aNone that I am aware of.   We need to take positions that support our long term view of competitive energy markets for all consumers.\u000a
p3826
aV\u000a\u000aJoe Holmes from IdaCorp (208-318-2100) called and expressed interest in <NAME/>'s services deals in the NA, presumably in the West.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - can you have someone follow-up.   thanks.\u000a
p3827
aV\u000a\u000aThe source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant $'s every year.   I estimate $10-15 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market.\u000a\u000aTherefore, we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3828
aV\u000a\u000aI do not agree with this approach.   We are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade.  I strongly object to your recommended approach.\u000a
p3829
aV\u000a\u000aThe highlights I would focus on are:\u000a\u000a1) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 (compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000)\u000a2) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD (compared to 100 in 2000).   In the last two weeks, EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500.\u000a3) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market.\u000a4) Positive P&L in every Eastern region\u000a5) Outstanding return on VAR.\u000a
p3830
aV\u000a\u000aMake sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any VEPCO interface (hourly or day-ahead), and the PJM/VEPCO PJM LMP index is for pricing only.\u000a
p3831
aV\u000a\u000aI hear you on the liquidity <NAME/>.   With <NAME/> making those markets effective next Monday (he is on vacation), we will find out if term liquidity is possible.\u000a\u000aPlease trust me on this issue.   You will see a significant difference within weeks, not months.   At a minimum, you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders (they may be $3 wide in New York, but that is better than no market).\u000a\u000aKeep pushing on this issue.   With the volatility in the NE over the past two weeks, I'm sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas.\u000a\u000aAs far as 02 or 03 quotes for E PJM and/or NY, I have heard no markets today and neither has Dana.   The pool is blowing up as we speak.\u000a
p3832
aV\u000a\u000aI sit at 06543 (will be moving Wednesday/Thursday).   I can meet mid-morning tommorow.   Get on my calender with TJ at 35800.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3833
aV\u000a\u000aGood to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift - much appreciated.  The family is great - <NAME/> just turned 3 and <NAME/> is now 4 months old.\u000a\u000aI hope <NAME/> and the kids are doing great - how's your new addition?   We will be going to Miami Sept 13-16 (Miami revenge on Washington) and hopefully we can hook up for a beer.\u000a\u000aAs far as the guy from Citizens - we really don't know that much about him.   Where is <NAME/> Altman - under a bus somewhere?\u000a
p3834
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAre we are discussing the Phoenix project at this Wednesday's meeting?   Is Terry going to be there?\u000a
p3835
aV\u000a\u000aYou will probably be glad you didn't go.   If the boys are in jail in Mexico, you may have to run the desk the next week.\u000a
p3836
aV\u000a\u000aPlease complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.  \u000a\u000aKeep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The "liquidity reserve" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3837
aV\u000a\u000aWe need all historical data preserved in all markets (price, vol, trades by counterparty, volume by counterparty, broker vs. EOL, broker prices, EOL prices, etc.)\u000a
p3838
aV\u000a\u000asold 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 05 nymex at $3.695/mmbtu.\u000asold 5,000 mmbtu/day of cal 04 nymex at $3.58/mmbtu.\u000a
p3839
aV\u000a\u000aYou've got that right.   I'm am short all of the power and am getting frustrated.   I am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power.   There seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels.\u000a\u000aIn particular, the NE markets refuse to go down despite the fact that Benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 02 and 03 period.   For the 1st time in a couple of weeks, however, the cash market is showing signs of weakness.\u000a\u000aOverall, I am very bearish and my position reflects that.   Like you, I have worn some curveshift the past month.\u000a
p3840
aV\u000a\u000aDeny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification.\u000a
p3841
aV\u000a\u000aPlease remind me to file expense report from CT trip.   In addition, please block my calender from Feb 6th to 10th for Florida (Miami) vacation.   Please also change the March vacation to March 9-13 (Disneyworld).\u000a
p3842
aV\u000a\u000aI concur.   You know we are likely selling New Albany this week and I am assuming ENA's premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset.\u000a
p3843
aV\u000a\u000aOnly if nuclear fuel storage problems persist.   The nuclear fleet, if unencumbered by NRC or spent fuel storage problems, will operate at 90-95% (95% during non-refueling years and 90% during re-fueling years).\u000a \u000aRemember re-fuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003.   The 2002 re-fueling outages are actually less than normal.\u000a
p3844
aV\u000a\u000aYes, Lavo and <NAME/> are both aware.   This is a lateral transfer.   <NAME/> will be working directly for <NAME/>.\u000a
p3845
aV\u000a\u000aCan we enter a retainer agreement with <NAME/> at Bracewell and have her attend this meeting on our behalf.   <NAME/> - What is your budget for this year on outside services?\u000a
p3846
aV\u000a\u000aI did a spread today with <NAME/>:\u000a\u000aSold 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 03\u000aBought 10,000/MMBtu/day of Cal 05\u000a\u000aPaid $0.12/MMBtu for the spread\u000a
p3847
aV\u000a\u000aNot at all.  Please attend.   However, we will need a bigger room.   Can you coordinate with TJ to make this happen.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3848
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the info <NAME/>.   In terms of forward curve, Entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now.   The equipment is probably of more interest as it relates to a packaged development for the Midway project in Florida.\u000a
p3849
aV\u000a\u000aAs soon as I get access to crude, resid, & coal curves, I will grant access to power curves.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3850
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.   I think <NAME/> would fit in with our group well.   I probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues.    My guess is we will end up losing 2-3 people and outside candidates then become viable.\u000a
p3851
aV\u000a\u000aI understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose <NAME/> (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.   This is pretty easy math for me.\u000a\u000aI know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.   I would like to get this done ASAP.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3852
aV\u000a\u000aPlease ensure that real-time prices for ERCOT, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL are added to the cube database.   I have been analyzing the data today and the real-time clearing prices are not there.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3853
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> Havilend about Paine Webber keeping my on-line portfolio manager updated with all of my <NAME/> options.   Entering options is tricky and I was hoping you can provide that service for me.\u000a\u000aLet me know.\u000a
p3854
aV\u000a\u000aMy preference is normal energy only LD language.  If we agree to use an index pricing point (like PJM/VEPCO interface), then a fair trade-off is to eliminate the capacity ratchet.\u000a
p3855
aV\u000a\u000a1.  <NAME/> can trade any region with 30 day limit and total position limit of 100 MW.    <NAME/> will do mostly spread trades.\u000a2.  Per our earlier discussion\u000a3.  Ontario is part of the NE and we plan on having an Ontario market maker.   I have to sort this out with Milly.   Please stay silent on this one until we get the deal closed.\u000a4.\u000a
p3856
aV\u000a\u000aFiling looks good.  My vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached.\u000a \u000aIf we file the 203 as well, FERC will gravitate directly toward that.   I think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach.\u000a \u000aOther thoughts?   I will be in Florida (vacation) Wednesday through Friday.    I can be reached via cell and TJ will have my hotel phone #.    In addition, I will check e-mails at least once per day at the hotel business center.\u000a
p3857
aV\u000a\u000aI think you are probably correct.   Upon closure, you will probably be marking your own curves.   Having said that, you should probably begin now.\u000a
p3858
aV\u000a\u000aSold 150 contracts per month of Feb-Mar 02 at 2.81\u000a\u000aSold 50 contracts per month of Nov-Dec 02 at 3.24.\u000a\u000aBought Cal 06 at 3.60.\u000a
p3859
aV\u000a\u000aGood question.   We need to shift as of a specific date with fixed load obligations in the EWS retail books.\u000a
p3860
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.   I agree with the approach.   It would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the East and West trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything.\u000a\u000aSee you tommorow.\u000a
p3861
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> will have weather model and research material several minutes before the general market.   Universities receive the data before the market and this alliance will get the weather data to <NAME/> as if they were part of the university.\u000a\u000aAny thoughts?\u000a
p3862
aV\u000a\u000aI received an e-mail from <NAME/> Wolfe.   They do have needs for entry level people.   For whatever reason, he did not receive the attached resume in my previous e-mail.   Please send me a final version of your resume so I can forward to <NAME/>.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3863
aV\u000a\u000aCould I please get an updated valuation summary on the sale of New Albany.   Do not include the $10 million capacity unwind in the economics.\u000a\u000aI want only the MTM effects (the accrual benefits are gravy).\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3864
aV\u000a\u000a750k is BS.   <NAME/> has only been working on this for 3-4 weeks.   He has made one trip to Nebraska.   I expect more like 50-100k in costs incurred.   This is precisely why I told <NAME/> to work directly with <NAME/> on this project.\u000a\u000aWith respect to Ameren, <NAME/> should work directly with me and <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3865
aV\u000a\u000aResume looks impressive.   We should definitely interview him.   I forwarded e-mail to <NAME/> to see if she knows the guy from her London gas trading days.\u000a
p3866
aV\u000a\u000aI keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons.   I lose control of who has access outside my group, therefore, I have chosen to not make it available.   EOL has prices in all markets through 2003 which should be all you need to perform your analysis.\u000a
p3867
aV\u000a\u000aYes I would like to attend meeting regarding NRG deal and let's have a position meeting this afternoon at 4:00.   Does that work?   I will keep my ears open for Zone J and G markets.   PJM East markets are rarely shown except for summer spreads which are now $18-25/Mwh (approx.) for 02 and 03.\u000a
p3868
aV\u000a\u000aYou got it.  I will be in Cabo this weekend with Wolfe's boss (tim belden - my counterpart in the West) and I will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing.\u000a
p3869
aV\u000a\u000aI would support this 100%.   It is consistent with the direction that Whalley, Lavo, and Delainey are headed with the retail risk management group.\u000a
p3870
aV\u000a\u000aCan you please coordinate this meeting to ensure it is productive.   We may need an initial screening mtg. to assess whether the tool can help us from a fundamental/trading standpoint.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3871
aV\u000a\u000aWe just successfully bought out of the 02 OPPD capacity and energy obligation.   Therefore, we don't need to proceed with the diesel installation.\u000a\u000aI have instructed <NAME/> to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in Nebraska.\u000a\u000aIn addition, I would like to pursue an 02 LM6000 project inside Ameren (approx. 100-150 MW).   This would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections Ameren has with multiple systems.   We also have significant retail load obligations behind IP and Ameren in Illinois.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3872
aV\u000a\u000aAs most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.\u000a \u000aOver the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.\u000a \u000aMy strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   \u000a \u000aIn the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.\u000a \u000aGiven the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   \u000a \u000aIf we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.\u000a \u000aLavo and <NAME/> - This could be the "<NAME/> PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.\u000a \u000aAny thoughts?\u000a
p3873
aV\u000a\u000aI want only firm delivered LD offers for this position.   Please make this clear in our proposal and make sure the volume shape is exactly the same as our JEA obligation.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3874
aV\u000a\u000aWe have a meeting with Evans Automation next Saturday 11/10 at 10:30 am (near Kemah).   Please mark the calender.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOn the new phone card (some later date), please include <NAME/> Herndon, <NAME/> Richter, <NAME/> Belden and <NAME/> Dayou under retail risk management (new category on the card).\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3876
aV\u000a\u000aMy Holdings page is still not netting.   I just purchased 5000 DYN shares - please make sure the netting works.\u000a
p3877
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> is my fundies interface, and, in general, we have received very good support from Research.\u000a
p3878
aV\u000a\u000aA former FPL employee (<NAME/> Olan) will be calling you regarding a potential alternative to Orimulsion.   The fuel is sourced from US refinery and can be burned in the same manner as Orimulsion, creating two fuel sources.\u000a\u000aLet me know.\u000a
p3879
aV\u000a\u000aI say we don't make any changes until we get in the new building and we will have a better feel for the vendors.\u000a
p3880
aV\u000a\u000aAre we making sure everything is done on our end to liquidate and manage the EES retail positions effective 1/1/02.\u000a
p3881
aV\u000a\u000aFrom East Power's perspective, the East PJM development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of East PJM.\u000a
p3882
aV\u000a\u000aI am missing an <NAME/> 10,000 share sale from Monday of last week.   The sale has not shown up in my on-line "holdings" report as it normally does.\u000a\u000aI am assuming this will be corrected today.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3883
aV\u000a\u000aI generally agree with your approach.  We may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid (because of margin in contract vs. current market), particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it.   Potential candidates are Green Mountain, New Power Co, TXU, etc.\u000a\u000aAny thoughts?\u000a
p3884
aV\u000a\u000aI'm not doing this interview.   I told <NAME/> Duran we have no interest, and I'm not going to waste my time on this individual.\u000a
p3885
aV\u000a\u000aTJ,\u000a \u000aPlease provide me with the latest hard copy so I can have one final meeting with my direct reports to get final confirmation for East Power seating.\u000a \u000aThanks.\u000a
p3886
aV\u000a\u000aFind out if owners of current season tickets get grandfathered for equivalent seats in the new arena.   If so, I would be interested.   If not, I would say no.\u000a
p3887
aV\u000a\u000aI agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3888
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $'s - THIS CREATES NO NET IMPACT ON TOTAL $'S ON THE SPREADSHEET\u000a\u000aGain 575 cash 450 equity (<NAME/> Herndon, <NAME/> Forney, Joe Wagner, <NAME/> May)\u000a\u000aRe-allocate in the following manner:\u000a			Cash		Equity\u000a	Arora		+75k		+75k\u000a	Gilb-Smith	+25k		+25k\u000a	<NAME/>		+25k		+25k	\u000a	Gupta		+25k		+25k\u000a	Misra		+75k		+75k\u000a	Suarez		+50k		+50k\u000a	<NAME/>		+25k		+25k\u000a	Imai		+25k		+25k\u000a	Steffes		+50k		+50k (we will lose key reg people if we don't pay)\u000a	Nicolay		+50k		+50k ("                            "                            ") \u000a	Novosel		+25k		+25k ("                            "                            ") \u000a\u000a	\u000a\u000aPlease call with any questions.   I feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this.\u000aAgain, I am not spending any additional $'s - I am simply taking from other people who will not be part of UBS.\u000a
p3889
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is out.   We are not extending an employment at will offer.   Please destroy the contract offer and "drafted" employee at will offer.\u000a
p3890
aV\u000a\u000aI like your approach.   Would the Norfolk location fill the UI short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit?\u000a
p3891
aV\u000a\u000aHe's making his rounds.   I believe he is talking with Corp Risk and Reck.   I get the impression he doen't want to be anywhere near an energy commodity that has a relationship with power (which, of course, is all of them)\u000a
p3892
aV\u000a\u000aI am trying to customize the view and I keep getting an error.   Can you check into this problem.\u000a\u000aI want the view for both portfolios to be:		Open Date\u000a						<NAME/>\u000a						Purchase Price\u000a						Last Price\u000a						Cost Basis\u000a						Market Value\u000a						Gain/Loss\u000a						Gain/Loss%\u000a\u000aCan you make this the default view setting.\u000a\u000athanks.\u000a
p3893
aV\u000a\u000aBecause we have lost several people to retail risk management (<NAME/> Herndon, Narsima Misra, <NAME/> Homco, etc.) and <NAME/> Forney has moved to ERCOT hourly, I have been forced to manage an EOL stack for multiple markets.\u000a\u000aTherefore, all tours during trading hours (6:30 am to 3:30 pm) will have to be provided by non-trading personnel.\u000a\u000aSorry, but we are in our busiest season and I cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes.\u000a
p3894
aV\u000a\u000aThe time is right in the middle of trading on an AGA day.   Therefore, it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend.   I would suggest having <NAME/> May and/or <NAME/> attend.\u000a
p3895
aV\u000a\u000aCould you please make sure this is on my calender and ensure that <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Duran are also aware of this meeting.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3896
aV\u000a\u000aAll East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me.    With respect to regions, assume the same organization as we ended with in early November.   The one change is <NAME/> in the SE along with Suarez, and <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aMW - <NAME/>, <NAME/>, and <NAME/>\u000aSE - <NAME/>, Suarez, <NAME/>\u000aERCOT - <NAME/>, <NAME/>, Schiavone, Saibi\u000aNE - Dana, Benson, Gupta, <NAME/>, <NAME/> (off-peak), Misra, <NAME/>, Makkai, Step, Schneider\u000aOptions - Arora, Stalford, Wang, Gualy\u000aReal-Time - Forney (ERCOT), Baughman (MW/SE), <NAME/> (MW/SE)\u000a\u000aRemember, all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well.   None of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas.\u000a
p3897
aV\u000a\u000aI believe Wabash has also terminated.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>,\u000aAs you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.\u000a \u000aI will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.\u000a
p3898
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> can be reached by e-mail at drherndon@aol.com.\u000a\u000aHe would like updates on activities everyday if possible.\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3899
aV\u000a\u000aI need the reg gen postion, transmission position, distribution position, and ancillary position.   If you have to bundle the T&D and ancillary into one position, that is fine.   However, I want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the MWh position.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p3900
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly.   This essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept.   Can we at least get a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period?\u000a
p3901
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.\u000a\u000aHe mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.\u000a
p3902
aV\u000a\u000aWe are in jail in off-peak as well and are trying to buy.   Most regions have markets on-line through 2003 (TVA, Ent, Cinergy, Com-ed).   In NY, there is zero liqidity for off-peak.   PJM West has pretty decent liquidity through 03.\u000a\u000aI hope this helps.\u000a
p3903
aV\u000a\u000aI will be in town Monday and Tuesday.   Out Wed-Fri in Florida.   I will definitely help on Monday and/or Tuesday.   I can make arrangements for backups later in the week if necessary.\u000a \u000aLet me know.\u000a
p3904
aV\u000a\u000aLooks like Enpower is "on the side of the road" with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals.   As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, Plan B is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component.\u000a\u000aI know this is easier said than done, but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct, rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions.\u000a
p3905
aV\u000a\u000aNo problem.   $0.50/Mwh is enough for this service.   You don't need to pay a $1.00/Mwh.   I would say anytime she gets more that $75/Mwh, she gets a $1.00/Mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price.\u000a\u000aSound OK?\u000a
p3906
aV\u000a\u000aOK - <NAME/> did say he blew up trading options in the West.   Played the "premium is profit" game selling summer calls at Palo Verde and we all know what happened.   Bye Bye <NAME/>.\u000a
p3907
aV\u000a\u000aPlease arrange a room for an East Power Mtg at 10:00 am this morning.\u000a \u000aAgenda:\u000a\u000aUBS Warburg Energy Closing/Implementation\u000aOrganization/Roles\u000aOn-line products (which products and when)\u000aPower documents (EEI and ISDA)\u000a
p3908
aV\u000a\u000aIn addition, make sure we understand the steam obligation and it's effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate.  It appears the 8000 Heat Rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate.   Solar turbines in combined cycle (without a steam sale credit) would usually have a heat rate around 10,000 Btu/kwh.\u000a\u000aThe lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam, which means less dispatch flexibility and producing off-peak energy at a loss.\u000a\u000aMake sure we are modeling these dynamics properly.\u000a

p3917
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your help on all my stuff.  Everything should be set up just like April 11.  Its in the system as <NAME/> SIQ for both companies, and the 10301 DIQ for Peoples only, No DIQ for NS.  This could change slightly in the morning, but my guess is it won't.  I already balanced out <NAME/> Co and Other City gates and took 72000 to Peoples.  Kelly needs to buy at least the short at amarillo.  Thanks again and I'll check with you in the morning to make sure everything is ok.  I'll have my pager if there is a major crisis, I dont anticipate one though.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a	Sorry for all the resumes lately, but everyone wants to get their foot in the door at <NAME/>.  This resume is from my wife's cousin, who is looking to get a summer internship at <NAME/>.  She is a very sharp young lady with a great work ethic.  I don't know if you are hiring for internships, if not, could you please forward this on to the person hiring for those positions.  I greatly appreciate any help you could give.

aV\u000a\u000aMy apology for missing the Dynegy Board meeting that <NAME/> told me today at !:00pm that you wanted me to attend.  I had my international team in for business and budget reviews and to discuss what "non-core" means since both Dynegy and <NAME/> have labeled them as such.  We need to keep these folks motivated to get us through the sale process.  I couldn't reschedule them since they were heading home tonight.  They are fine and willing to see this through.  Please let <NAME/> know that I just had a conflict.\u000a\u000aCongratulations on a very successful rollout with the Analysts on Monday.  Sorry I couldn't go to Chicago with <NAME/> but it appeared I would have been a detraction.  I would like to sit down over luch with you when you have the time to see what your plans are.  In the meantime call if I can be of any help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI have it on my calendar and <NAME/> would like to come also.  The plane can only fit so many so be careful you don't over invite if they are counting on the plane for transportation.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a

p3934
aV\u000a\u000aIt looks good to me.\u000a
p3935
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.  The Dynegy folks took me to New York for the analyst prsentations and made a big deal about <NAME/>'s pipelines and about me coming over.  The only problem is they never asked me if I was planning on going over.  I know their CEO and COO very well so I will probably have a choice.  I would like to see this thing through.  I committed in my current contract to stay until 3/1/05 so I would like to keep my commitment even though the options they gave me sign the contract are worthless.  I do feel an obligation to help right the ship.  My businesses keep performing well and are anchoring the ship right now.  Employees are pretty scared so having some key executives stand up and commit to stay is pretty critical.  Either way I will be fine.  Thanks for your concern.  It means alot.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything.  I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.  I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters.  Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.  At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.\u000a\u000aYou and I also need to do a budget review.  The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.  I had truly hoped that <NAME/>'s group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.  <NAME/>'s group was covering ETs and EOTT.  I think <NAME/> has a PR person so we need to find out what PR costs are in the Wind company.  Also NBP's has there own PR person.\u000a\u000aPlease set up a meeting with <NAME/> and Tracy.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI trust everything is going well.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.  At the next Board meeting I am sheduled to provide the Board with an update of <NAME/> Global Services.  Could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on Portland.  One should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 2001 (ie rate case etc) in bullet form.  The second should be an update of the deal with NNG.  Perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events.  Call if you have questions.  Thanks.  The Board meeting is scheduled for December 6th.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIt sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.\u000a\u000aI am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and <NAME/> installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.\u000a\u000aWhat is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.\u000a\u000aLet's talk by phone this week if possible.\u000a
p3949
aV\u000a\u000aI am ok with the release and the MOU.\u000a
p3950
aV\u000a\u000aI know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.  I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that <NAME/> McMahon did receive the offer from the <NAME/> Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of <NAME/> accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Lay and Dynegy have both characterised <NAME/>'s investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if <NAME/> could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.  Again, please send me your comments.  I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFirst of all congratulations on completing your degree.  Having completed my Masters degree by going to school at nights and Saturdays while working full time I know first hand the commitment that takes.

Between the two of them they should be able to offer you the right advise.  Keep me informed.\u000a

p3964
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  I am not surprised that we asked to meet with them but I am surpeised that <NAME/> did not mention it to me.  Communication here is not great.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLunch is not good this week.  I have a business lunch tomorrow.  Thursday is the GISB Board meeting.  Are you going?  I"ll give you a ride there and to your car afterwards if you do not need to come back downtown to work.  Let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3970
aV\u000a\u000aWe are on for lumch.  The guys wanted to play golf Saturday at 11:30 but I told them I had lunch with you and couldn't make it.\u000a
p3971
aV\u000a\u000aYou have my permission to just refer them to <NAME/> Donahue.  <NAME/> is in the process of naming individuals to assist in the disposition of our international assets.  Corporate development, EGAS and investment bankers will collectively pursue the disposition.  I woould think Dr. <NAME/> should be so advised of the process we are going to use.  <NAME/> or his designee can deliver this message if you would like.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I assume this is the right approach given our converstion.\u000a
p3972
aV\u000a\u000aAre we sure we want to do a Board presentation on my group.  Everyone is so busy doing a presentation is not on anyone's priority list?  If so do we want to just do the pipes or all of Global Services?\u000a

p3977
aV\u000a\u000aCalm down.  The operative word is it has been put on hold.  These are not normal times.  No one saw this coming or we could have planned better.  Give us a few days to figure everything out.  We just made the decision today to preserve cash while we were waiting to see what was going to happen.  Thanks for your cooperation which I desperately need right now.\u000a
p3978
aV\u000a\u000aGood days are now impossible!\u000a

p3980
aV\u000a\u000aI can't begin to tell you what my days  are like now.  Unbelievable is the only way I can Describe it.  Not much time to do anything.  Stress is at a record high.  We will get through this though.\u000a\u000aDK and I will be going to the game tonight to see the Lakers.  Talk to you tomorrow,\u000a\u000aLove, Daddy\u000a

p3982
aV\u000a\u000aThank you for your kind words.  We will get through this and we all will be better for it.  Lessons are sometimes learned the hard way.\u000a
p3983
aV\u000a\u000aPlease set this up for Monday.\u000a
p3984
aV\u000a\u000aWe definately need to talk ASAP.  Please call <NAME/> or call me at home 281.320.1240.  With regard to 1) and 2) the answer for now is no for now.  Between <NAME/> and <NAME/> we will keep you covered.  You will have to work double load for a while longer with regard to Americas-GM.  The O&M makes sence.  Go ahead.  I will explain all this when I talk with you.\u000a
p3985
aV\u000a\u000aI agree the timing is awful.  By this memo I am asking <NAME/> Smith to see if this can be expedited in any way.\u000a
p3986
aV\u000a\u000aI will await <NAME/>'s call.  Can you fill me in on what is happening with Wessex.  <NAME/> Skellet has been notified that the potential buyer is coming here to have discussions with McMahon.  I need to get in the information loop if at all possible. Thanks\u000a
p3987
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.  Much appreciated.\u000a
p3988
aV\u000a\u000aI don't like the answer tho the last question.  Can we add that under the agreements we could cancel as early as (date) but no decision has been made with regards when actual termination would occur?\u000a
p3989
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.  I have 18 month old twins who could care less about my distractions.  They are my stress outlet now.  Happy Thanksgiving.\u000a
p3990
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  You got the message correct.  We will not accept a firesale price but if the price is fair we are sellers.  It is a tough message to deliver but people need to hear the truth.   I appreciate your efforts in arranging the floor meeting.  Any news on Eco?\u000a
p3991
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  Right now I know of no available opportunities but will keep you in mind.\u000a
p3992
aV\u000a\u000aI WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS.  PLEASE CALL TOMORROW IF POSSIBLE.  I THINK WE SHOULD PUT A NUMBER ON THE TABLE.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3993
aV\u000a\u000aThank you.  I feel I have neglected Wessex and you with all that is going on.  The truth is that <NAME/>, <NAME/> and you are very capable of proceeding with little input from me.  I did make sure with Corporate Development that <NAME/> had to be involved along with you and your team.  Communication here is not the greatest so please keep me updated.  Thanks.\u000a
p3994
aV\u000a\u000aThat is your call.  I am trying to make sure everyone is looking at their group and properly assessing where we can become more efficient.  You have to way the benefits vs. cost.\u000a
p3995
aV\u000a\u000aThe normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an <NAME/> VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the exception being granted.\u000a
p3996
aV\u000a\u000aHow much does putting out the newsletter cost?  How often are you proposing to put it out?  Does it replace any other newsletters?  Is there any new information in the newsletter or just restatements of what <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> have already said?  Need to make sure we have included <NAME/> <NAME/>'s group in what constitutes EGS.  Especially NEPCO.\u000a
p3997
aV\u000a\u000aHopefully you know what this is about\u000a
p3998
aV\u000a\u000aI am having lunch today with El Paso's CEO for their international group (<NAME/> Kelley).  The meeting was set up to discuss El Paso's public positions in Brazil and the problems <NAME/> was having with them.  I will add your concerns to the list of items to discuss and get back with you.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p3999
aV\u000a\u000aI have no idea what this project is so an update would be appreciated.  Please set something up with my assistant <NAME/> Stark.  Thanks.\u000a
p4000
aV\u000a\u000aOk, but please expedite. Also, you should be aware that <NAME/> has informed me of his need to pursue going on short-term disability.  We are looking at internal candidates to serve as the CFO for the interim period as we seek to seel <NAME/> Wind.  You will of cource have input into the decision.  My first interview is Monday with a <NAME/> Miller who is in corporate development.  I will keep you informed.\u000a
p4001
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.  Should have known you were in control of the situation.  By the way, how are you doing with all of this?\u000a

p4004
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has forwarded to me your letter of October 18 wherein you asked how <NAME/> wanted to handle several activities which you are now engaged (Trojan nuclear plant decommissioning, contract review for offshore sales and rep agreements and involvement in Transparency International).\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has asked me to work with you on this.  Please let me know a good time to discuss.  Thank you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Horton\u000a
p4005
aV\u000a\u000aWhat meeting on Tuesday?  No one has informed me of a Tuesday meeting.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWhat is the subject matter you wish to visit about?\u000a
p4008
aV\u000a\u000aFrom a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.  The issue is is it doable?  We have achieved $600 million last year.  Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.  Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with <NAME/>/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aT\u000ahe first detailed allegations that <NAME/>\u000aabused mark-to-market accounting to\u000ahide wholesale trading losses have\u000aemerged in congressional testimony pro-vided\u000aby a professor and former deriva-tives\u000atrader who reviewed the <NAME/> case\u000afor Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.\u000aThose charges, along with allega-tions\u000athat have surfaced that mark-to-market\u000aaccounting was misused by <NAME/>\u000aEnergy Services, the company's retail\u000aenergy and services unit, are expected to\u000asupport the push by accounting rulemak-ers\u000afor much more disclosure on mark-to-market\u000aaccounting practices and the\u000aimpact of mark-to-market accounting on\u000aearnings trading firms' earnings.\u000aIn testimony Thursday before the\u000aSenate Governmental Affairs Committee\u000alast week, <NAME/> Partnoy of the Universi-ty\u000aof San <NAME/> Law School, said it\u000aappears that <NAME/> traders mismarked\u000aforward curves and manipulated the\u000aamount of profits and losses that would\u000abe reported in financial statements.\u000a"In a nutshell, it appears that some\u000a<NAME/> employees used dummy accounts\u000aand rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate\u000afalse profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives\u000a<NAME/> traded," said Partnoy, who\u000areviewed the case over several weeks at the\u000acommittee's request. "It appears that <NAME/>\u000atraders selectively mismarked their forward\u000acurves, typically in order to hide losses."\u000a"Traders are compensated based on\u000atheir profits," he observed, "so if a trader\u000acan hide losses by mismarking forward\u000acurves, he or she is likely to receive a\u000alarger bonus."\u000aPartnoy said mismarking forward\u000acurves was not the only problem.\u000a"For each trade," he testified, "a\u000atrader would report either a profit or loss,\u000atypically in spreadsheet format. These\u000aprofit-and-loss reports were designed to\u000areflect economic reality. Frequently they\u000adid not. Instead of recording the entire\u000aprofit for a trade in one column, some\u000atraders reportedly split the profit from a\u000atrade into two columns. The first column\u000areflected the portion of the actual profits\u000athe trader intended to add to <NAME/>'s cur-rent\u000afinancial statements. The second col-umn,\u000aironically labeled the 'prudency'\u000areserve, included the remainder."\u000aPartnoy told the committee that in\u000ahis estimation, "<NAME/>'s 'prudency'\u000areserves did not depict economic reality,\u000anor could they have been intended to do\u000aso. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund\u000athat could be used to smooth out profits\u000aand losses over time. The portion of prof-its\u000arecorded as 'prudency' could be used\u000ato offset any future losses," he said.\u000aHe recommended that investigators\u000aquestion <NAME/> employees who were\u000ainvolved in these transactions "to get a sense\u000aof whether my summaries are complete."\u000aAlleged <NAME/> abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge\u000a

Who would you like for me to hand these over to?\u000a<NAME/>/Centana \u000aMoney wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\u005cgas structuring\u005ccentana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for <NAME/> Field Services was <NAME/> Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. \u000aPonderosa Energy Partners \u000aI have been helping <NAME/> Hill and <NAME/> <NAME/> manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\u005cgas structuring\u005ctenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project.

aV\u000a\u000aENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, <NAME/> Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  <NAME/> Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg). \u000a\u000aI have spoken with <NAME/> Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.\u000a\u000a I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow).

aV\u000a\u000awell, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is not much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm used to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time and i don't work very long days.  \u000a\u000ai had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good to be back, too.  \u000a\u000ayour schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i would be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.  \u000a\u000atake care,\u000acooper\u000a

V\u000a\u000aIt is my understanding that five AEP employees will in <NAME/>'s offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect <NAME/>'s proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.\u000a\u000aAnother issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:\u000a\u000a	1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.\u000a\u000a	2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aCase 1\u000aCore term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)\u000aThirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and <NAME/>)\u000aTotal Index Position           300,000/d long\u000a\u000aVols. targeted for storage   200,000/d\u000a\u000a<NAME/> sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  <NAME/> sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.\u000a\u000aCase 2\u000aCore term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)\u000aThirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua <NAME/>, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d <NAME/>)\u000aTotal Index Position            200,000 long\u000a\u000aVols. targeted for storage    200,000/d\u000a\u000a<NAME/> sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.\u000a
p4396
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aLet's talk because I think it may make more sense to flip the other way.  I was hoping to continue using <NAME/> in the morning in the cash trading activities.  So maybe he can run the Texas Risk group while trading phyical similar to what <NAME/> is doing on the Logistics side.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4397
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel.  Right now <NAME/> Farmer is evaluating an opportunity with AEP.  If he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts; I may be in a situation that I have to do something with <NAME/>.  If <NAME/> leaves then <NAME/> is really the only one remaining with Waha experience, that is why I decided to move him to the desk.  Bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience, <NAME/> is definitely a keeper for Risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if <NAME/> leaves.  Needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but I thought you should be aware it, particularly if I end up in a situation where I have to make more cuts.\u000a\u000aI am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what I am going through.  I will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put <NAME/> out of your plans at this point.  I have explained this situation to him and I think he understands given he is new to trading.\u000a\u000aAny thoughts?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4398
aV\u000a\u000aKelley,\u000a\u000aGiven our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual things happening in the "Fixed Float" markets in Texas particularily at HSC.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the <NAME/> Hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.31 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration.\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p4399
aV\u000a\u000aCould you send me an updated list of the traders remaining vacation days for 2001.  I am hearing a lot of members of the desk wanting to get their vacation by the end of the year.

p4400
aV\u000a\u000aI did not know if you heard that <NAME/> has agreed to settle the dispute over NNG and will fullfill the earlier agreement to deliver the pipeline to Dynegy.  <NAME/> has the right to  buy it back by June 30th.  <NAME/> will still proceed with the 10 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include NNG in that suit.  Bottom line for now NNG employees will become Dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved and/or unless <NAME/> excercises its right to buy it back.  I wonder if this will impact <NAME/> and <NAME/>?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aP.S. Are you out of bed yet, ya bum?\u000a
p4401
aV\u000a\u000aAn issue has come up that I did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for June should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not.  Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua <NAME/>, Thompsonville, Oasis <NAME/>, Lonestar <NAME/>, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as <NAME/> Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4402
aV\u000a\u000aMaybe we should meet.  I am not sure what <NAME/> has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change.  My objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job.  The bottom line is that <NAME/> is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move <NAME/> into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under the impression that <NAME/> cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4403

aV\u000a\u000aIt seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at Klein Oak or Klein..  I guess the question is how much have the pool fees gone up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air.  Who knows the prices?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4405
aV\u000a\u000aI am sorry that you are having problems with <NAME/>.  I am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like <NAME/> feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure <NAME/> that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (<NAME/>) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask <NAME/> how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and <NAME/> have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.\u000a\u000aTo answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of uncertainty with the Dynegy and <NAME/> merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let everything else work itself out.\u000a\u000aI am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably about bed time.\u000a\u000aThanks for writing to me.\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the invite, but I can't come during trading hours.  This was a huge accomplishment and all those involved in getting this done should be complimented.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p4410
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSince the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live with it.  <NAME/> Miller had a good idea, how about if we see if we can also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aP.S. you either respond to this address (work) or the other address you have for me.\u000a
p4411
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aA dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.\u000a\u000aI know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to <NAME/>.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.\u000a
p4412
aV\u000a\u000aJust a heads up, I lost <NAME/> Farmer as my Logistics Manager/Transportation person on Thursday.  I have asked <NAME/> if he would be interested.  He said he would give me an answer on Monday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4413
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aLavo has given me the idea that <NAME/> Redmond may not be part of NETCO and it is possible that the Texas Gas Origination business may go away completely.  I would like to talk to you before you make a final decision.  I do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the East and Central it is a source of information for the trading business.  It is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in Texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market.  My opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process.  Give me a call to discuss at 713-853-3079.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Rabon is an Analyst in the Texas Risk Group who is interested in interviewing for the Trading Track Program.  He joined the company in February 2001 from Coastal where he worked in their natural gas risk group.  He seems to be sharp, aggressive and willing to work hard.  Can he still be considered or will he need to wait for the next round?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4415
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYou or <NAME/> need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4416
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI agree.  The traders need access only to the physcal trading systems.  They are only trading next day physical gas for the remainder of May, so they do not need access to any other systems.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4417
aV\u000a\u000aPlease forward the information to Eddie Leschber and Laynie East.  I know the origination was classified as Gas Assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group.  If those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 1st and 2nd quarters need to move to Gas Assets.  Ask Eddie and Laynie how they want to handle it.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is your internal competition.  If you have any dirt on any of these people please let <NAME/> know.  Just kidding.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4421
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  I asked her and I couldn't get anything out of her without her getting more emotional, so I decided to back off.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4422
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was just made aware yesterday that I am to provide my direct reports the following material.  Please make a cursory review and tell <NAME/> Koehler by noon today if you have any matters that should be added to the schedule or corrections that should be made.  I don't anticipate that you will have any issues but I am required to provide this to you.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4423
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYes, I would like to talk to you.  I think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity.  I didn't realize that you would making this decision so soon.  Maybe we can talk after bidweek (early next week).  If that timing does not work let me know.  I am still not sure if or when Lavorato is going to give me a Trading Track analyst/associate.  But I still would like to talk to you before you make a decision.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4424
aV\u000a\u000athank you.  Looks like another year where everybody is going to try to get vacation in at the last minute.\u000a
p4425
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aNoon brunch would probably work better for me considering <NAME/>'s nap time and that Monday is a school day.  I will handling the kids solo since Lyne will be at MD <NAME/> with <NAME/> that day, so I hope everyone is patient with <NAME/> as sometimes he can be a little rowdy at restaurants (he has been known to inflict fear in waiters, waitresses and owners alike).  Remeber those days........\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have enclosed <NAME/> Trigg's resume.  She is interested in a Recruiter position, job # 00001088305, <NAME/> <NAME/> supervisor.  She is also interested in a Specialist/Sr. Specialist position in HR, job #0000108135, <NAME/> Miller supervisor.\u000a\u000aHer experience has been in marketing, human resources and recruiting.  If you can do anything to help I sure would appreciate it.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Schwieger and <NAME/> Farmer have left the Company.  I also changes some of the Stack Manager and Web Access settings for some of the other guys.  Call me if you have any questions.\u000a
p4429
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSorry, I have been out for a few days.  We have been marking the curves appropriately every day.  <NAME/> Bass and <NAME/> Baumbach have continued to get broker quotes twice daily for the duration of the book and to mark the curves correctly.  If you have any specific problems in Texas let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4430
aV\u000a\u000aIf this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it.  The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4431
aV\u000a\u000aSorry, I don't think I said her name;  it is <NAME/> <NAME/>.  I left a message for her so I bet you will be getting her resume in a day or so.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4432
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Slone has been in contact with you on my behalf about a clerical error that occurred when I tried to roll my remaining ESOP shares into the 401 K plan back in the August to September time frame.  She indicated that there may be reason to believe that I will be reimbursed for this error but you were waiting for further information on the matter.  Given that I will be going with the sale of the trading business to UBS in early to mid February, I wanted to get this situation cleaned up by then if at all possible.  What steps do we need to go through to get closure on this matter?  Is there anything I can do to help (ie. explain in person what happened)?\u000a\u000aAny explanation that you can give as to how and when this error gets fixed will be greatly appreciated.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4433
aV\u000a\u000aI left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the <NAME/> shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.\u000a\u000aSo where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.\u000a\u000aPlease call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4434
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you send me <NAME/>'s evaluation form so I can write his midyear review?  <NAME/> was out today so I did not get to ask about feedback on <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4435
aV\u000a\u000aThe 29th is OK for me other than it is NX1 for Natural Gas.  Starting at 3:00 makes it possible but 4:00 would be better or even the 30th at 3:00 would be better.  I am assuming that a lot of thought has gone in to picking this day and other conflicts exist.  The other gas traders are going to have the same issue with this time so if it is the only time that works for everybody then I'll be there at 3:00.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4436
aV\u000a\u000aI think last year anyway the bulkhead issue only affected relays as we started all individual events from the blocks and move the timers for 25 and 50 yard swims.  No matter, I am over the "Kein Oak" deal and moving on to "Klein" just suggesting we look into the possibility of using their gym for the teams.  I will talk to <NAME/> about the rates and pass it on when we get.  Have a great weekend!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4437
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aMy suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: <NAME/>, San <NAME/> or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. <NAME/>) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.\u000a\u000aI don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4438
aV\u000a\u000aI haven't worked on TBG in four years, so I am probably not who you want on this matter.  I would suggest starting with <NAME/> Vickers or <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4439
aV\u000a\u000aSorry for the delay.  There will will be four from my family (including matthew).  We will be there.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4440
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.  It seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago.  So what are my options other than waiting until November 20th?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4441
aV\u000a\u000aI have it in my briefcase, I just forgot to get it out.  Another slow day so far.\u000a\u000aI checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per <NAME/>'s comments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basically does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So <NAME/>'s friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had no idea what these two entities did, kind of interesting.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4442
aV\u000a\u000aI looked over <NAME/>'s shoulder while he highlighted what needed to be deleted.  Disregard my phone call.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4443
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aDid you get the time for my interview of the meteorologist tomorrow?  Also I plan to attend the Gas Fundamentals presentation tomorrow afternoon from 2-4 if you can send me a reminder.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4444
aV\u000a\u000aMaybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that <NAME/> uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people.  Then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples.  When you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 15 people.  My guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people (Pre HPL Sale).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4445
aV\u000a\u000aWhat ages? Are there organized activities for them as well?  If not I think they will get bored after an hour or two.  I have not generally done it because I did not have time to keep up with them for such a long period of time.  Maybe someone can bring them up before lunch for a while.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4446
aV\u000a\u000aI just read an article on the Blomberg news service that says that there are now six bidders and it is expected to go on into the night.  Each bidder is in a separate conference rooms and the lawyers are going from room to room to get the latest bid and provide updates as to what the best bid amount and structure is.  Sounds wild.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4447
aV\u000a\u000aI know you are very busy with UBS stuff, so I e-mailed him just to see if there is anything I can do to help.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4448
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI will need 1 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate.  I have talked to <NAME/> Hull (third year analyst) about a one year rotation at our desk.  He spent his first rotation in the Texas Risk Group and did a great job.  His second rotation has been in the EOL Marketing Group.  He is interested in trading and is a sharp guy.  I would like to see some of the other folks coming in just to compare against him and to see if using an associate is a viable option for my cash trading needs.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4449
aV\u000a\u000aSorry we have not talked again recently.  I have been trying to get a better handle on other personnel movement on the gas floor that has an impact on my needs.  I would like to talk further with you.  Maybe we can get together next week after work for a beer and talk about what your interests are and I can tell you more about my needs.  I am open Tuesday - Thursday.  Let me know if you can get away.  If not let's try to set up some time to talk in the afternoon.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4450
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aDid you get a chance to discuss my ESOP rollover situation with your superiors.  I received an e-mail stating that the new Savings Plan is available early and I would like to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a
p4451
aV\u000a\u000aAny response yet from <NAME/> regarding <NAME/> Schwieger being part of the PRC process.  I think he should be included.  Please advise.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4452
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWhen are we going to reschedule the meeting to discuss the methodology that you are using to fulfill our "early distribution" from the phantom stock deferal account.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4453
aV\u000a\u000aIt looks like Joe has an expense report I need to review.  Let's discuss tomorrow.  Also <NAME/> mentioned in the staff meeting that we are going to be more directly accountable and able to control our allocated costs such as IT and logistics costs next year.  Please ask Laynie to give a detail of our budgeted allocated costs such as IT, logistics, etc for next so that we can review it.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4454
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  I got <NAME/>'s and <NAME/>'s right after lunch.  <NAME/> was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  <NAME/> seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4455
aV\u000a\u000aAs a follow up to the Texas Business plan submitted on January 7th, please find more detail on our desired product rollout schedule during phase 1 and 2.  If you have any questions call me at ext. 33079.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4456
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAny chance she can start sooner?  Can we leave her assigned to me until the end of June?  I am not trying to turn away help because I definitely need it;  I am struggling with her starting in August.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4457
aV\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> about the Texas opportunity and he seemed interested.  He still wanted to talk to <NAME/> <NAME/> about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).  I believe he is hesitant to leave the East environment because he is so familiar with it.  He said he will let me know on Monday morning.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4458
aV\u000a\u000aI would like our group to continue to get lunches at their desk if possible.  If other trading desks are not doing this then just the EOL trades.  Talk to <NAME/> and let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4459
aV\u000a\u000aI don't think we are interested in Hockey but Texans may be of interest.  Send an E-mail to Redmond for us to discuss.  Maybe we can share with another desk.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4460
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 2001 and my previous 2002 budget.  The total impact is to increase the budget by $68,000.  I also was not sure what your Rent, Technology and Transportation amounts were supposed to represent.  Based on our previous discussions I thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere, but I used your numbers anyway.  I am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in.\u000a\u000aCall me if you have any questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4461
aV\u000a\u000aLyne,\u000a\u000aMom called me today to ask if we would be available to join them Sunday morning December 16th as Dad is receiving an award at Church from the "Dominican Family".  She pointed out that day is the day that you and the girls are joining Mom for the Christmas function at Jones Hall.  Let's talk tonight.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4462
aV\u000a\u000aI am having <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> coordinate their vacation days for the rest of the year.  I am having <NAME/> and Joe do the same.  Clearly the calendar does not reflect what these guys will probably want to do by the end of the year.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4463
aV\u000a\u000aFrom my perspective the Waha, Exxon <NAME/> Tailgate and the new Carthage Tailgate product should be converted to ENA on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur June 1st.  Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4464
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere are the rates for May.  Again the A/D long haul rates are irrelevant for most of the month.  Call me if you have any questions.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4465
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you had a great holiday season!  Just checking to see if there is any new info on my ESOP rollover error situation.  Let me know if you heard anything.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4466
aV\u000a\u000aI am losing my Logistics Manager/Transportation person, <NAME/> Farmer to AEP.  I have talked to <NAME/> Germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job.  Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with <NAME/> leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like <NAME/> to spend part of his time next week downloading from <NAME/> as I have him through next Friday.\u000a\u000aOn another matter, I believe <NAME/> has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does <NAME/> Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (<NAME/> Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from <NAME/> next week.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAt this point I do not plan to attend.  I have not had an opportunity to take Lavo's pulse to see if this is a must attend.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4468
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you put me down for vacation November 5th.  If schedules conflict with others on the desk I need to be out the afternoon for sure (<NAME/>'s school function).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe only change I see needing to be made is you said letter "dated August 27, 2002" instead of "August 27, 2001" , but we knew what you meant.  Everything else looked great.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aDo we have another email address for <NAME/> <NAME/>?  My email to him was undeliverable.  Do you know if he will be at the meeting tonight?\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4561
aV\u000a\u000apricing are falling more.....Cal 02 is now $3.27.  EOL still does not have Perm Basis posted for Cal 02, but we suspect that it is in the $.11-.14 range.  FYI.\u000a
p4562
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,   FYI, prices this morning are still hanging in the $3.10-3.13 range for Permian Cal 02.  We are watching it closely.  I'll keep you posted if it starts to rally back up.  Thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4563
aV\u000a\u000aMansoor,  this is the other thing I was trying to remember when I was in your office this afternoon.  I would like to discuss this with you.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4564
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aTo get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.\u000a \u000aRent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .\u000a \u000aI agree with <NAME/>, your best hotel bet is the Marriott <NAME/>, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>'t forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!\u000a \u000aKeep us posted.  \u000a \u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4565
aV\u000a\u000aJ, D, P and J,\u000a\u000aHere is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car). \u000a\u000aFYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  <NAME/> is on the hunt for a <NAME/> hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for <NAME/> tonight and send them out tomorrow.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and <NAME/> are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.\u000a\u000aAlso, <NAME/> and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.\u000a\u000aI will keep you posted as we hear more. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4566
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you help interpret this impact of this decision on California customers for us?  Since we are looking at the Southern Trails system again, is this really good for them?  Exactly what is the rate the peaking customer would be charged?\u000a\u000aMany thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4567
aV\u000a\u000aPilar and <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI am sorry I will be unable to attend.  I do not return to town until Wed. evening.  Thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4568
aV\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I have a customer dinner planned for this evening.  I will let you know if my plans change.  Thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4569
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is another request for maps, however, I am thinking that I sent this person to you yesterday.  If this is repeat request, please disregard.  If not, please handle.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4570
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAs per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in <NAME/> and <NAME/> and I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let me know if you would like to book a telephone conference call Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.  \u000a\u000aHave a nice weekend and safe travel to <NAME/>!\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4571
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aPer my conversation with <NAME/> Guthrie, he ask me to add you to our distribution list for the due diligence team.  We hope that you can make it on Monday morning at 10:00am  EB 1336.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4572
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aPer your request, if Red <NAME/> was delayed, it would have a $1.1MM impact for June and a $1.6MM impact for July.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4573
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> or <NAME/> be able to attend and provide their historical knowledge?  \u000a\u000aI've got it booked on my calendar.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4574
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWell, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.  I know that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.  Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our pipe.  I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help you.\u000a\u000aThanks for keeping me posted,\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4575
aV\u000a\u000aYes, we did see this, thank you.  TW plans to be at the informational meeting in <NAME/> next week.  \u000a \u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4576
aV\u000a\u000aThis looks good to me.  Question:  Is there a tax/CIAC issue with Citizens reimbursing us for this change?  <NAME/> there be an addition to our property accounting records to reflect  a change to a pressure control system?  Because it's only $5,000, there may not be an issue, but I just wanted to check.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4577
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me know if we can do anything for you.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4578
aV\u000a\u000aBy the way, I don't think I finished my thought when we were talking about this earlier today.  Yes, you are correct that PNR revenue was only $1,200 in July.  Due to higher swings in the SoCal window causing higher line pack, parks were not made available most of the month.  TK continues to challenge our ability to accomodate PNR's.  The Daily Balancing Report is helping us to recognize opportunities for this service.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4579
aV\u000a\u000aWe have a response back from the Hotel Firenze (same hotel we stayed in before) in Rome for the last two nights of our trip (June 7 & 8) that they do have availability.  The rate is Euro 155.00 (according to the conversion rate I think this is about USD $136) for each room all including.  They will need credit card info if we want to confirm.\u000a\u000aI have not heard from the Hotel Conditti ( which is the hotel we had reservations for back in September and is located closer to the Spanish Steps than the Hotel Firenze) and hope to hear from them soon.  \u000a\u000aI have also not heard back from the Marincanto Hotel in Positano.  I'll keep you posted. \u000a\u000aI thought we would give the Hotel Conditti another day to respond before making our decision.  If Conditti does not have space or is too pricey, are we OK with booking the Hotel Firenze?  I have not checked into other Rome hotels.  Let me know if you would like me to investigate others.\u000a\u000aPlease advise.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4580
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is the Open Season Document on our Sun Devil Expansion.  Please call me if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4581
aV\u000a\u000aTK,\u000a\u000aAre you referring to the Dynegy deal in December being the "I to I" deal that we have already hedged?  Have you already included the previous "I to I" deals that you have done earlier in the year?  Outside of these deals, I am not aware of any others.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>\u000a
p4582
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAlthough we skimmed the surface on board replacements for <NAME/>, we should probably start a list of potential candidates.  Some of the names we mentioned last night were:\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Tarter\u000a<NAME/> Fenberg\u000aMuffin <NAME/>\u000a\u000aAny other names that come to mind?\u000a\u000a.....<NAME/> Eucker, <NAME/>, <NAME/> Semi, <NAME/> Brown, <NAME/> O'Neill... are other people who have been involved in various efforts.  Your thoughts?\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4583
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI just wanted to follow up with you that everyone in <NAME/>'s group (plus <NAME/> Dowd) have a place to land when we move.  I have not seen the area that you guys are supposed to move and I just want to make sure that no one falls through the crack.  Are you satisfied that you have spaces for all?  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4584
aV\u000a\u000aJerry,\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, our marketing department is off campus tomorrow with are Facility Planning group and will be unable to attend.  We will catch you next month.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4585
aV\u000a\u000aLindy, would you please look this over.  I did not see your name on the distribution list.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4586
aV\u000a\u000aI would like us all to attend this meeting.  Please let me know if you have a conflict.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4587
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWould you please write up a full description of what the scope of our plans are with PG&E.  This description will be useful to <NAME/> <NAME/> as he proceeds to determine the best way to secure funds for this project.  Please send it to me and I will add the virtual capacity write up to it and forward on to <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4588
aV\u000a\u000aAll,\u000a\u000aWe are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  \u000a\u000aPlease take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.\u000a\u000a\u000aDoes anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000aX33098\u000a
p4589
aV\u000a\u000aBobby,\u000a\u000aThanks for your help on this.  Let's talk early next week to see where you are on this and whether or not you will have to implement the interim plan.\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4590
aV\u000a\u000aYes, however, I thought I saw an earlier message from you booking this meeting at 9:00.  Either time works for me.  Please confirm. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4591
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned outage next week for two days.  We will talk with their commercial folks on Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.  We anticipate that we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead with their September business as usual.  We will also talk with the other SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down the lateral while Burlington is down. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4592
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aGosh, I am so sorry we have not connected yet.  I have been on a fast run.  How early in the morning do you come in?  Do I need to be at my desk?  How late in the evening are you in? \u000a\u000aI will make time for you.  Thanks for your persistence.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4593
aV\u000a\u000aI believe that <NAME/> and I will have to pass on this one.  <NAME/> (and I must admit that I, too) cannot afford to partake in any kind of all you can eat anything.  Our buttons are popping now.....\u000a\u000aHave fun on this one.  Eat a tail or two for me.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4594
aV\u000a\u000aLindy,\u000a\u000aCould you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?  Tiny is trying to complete his files.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4595
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> it be possible to reschedule my time for this training?  I just learned that I will be out of town on Wednesday.  Do you have any time next week available?  I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. \u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Watson.\u000aX33098\u000a
p4596
aV\u000a\u000aDear Gaylen and <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAttached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San <NAME/> area.  The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000.  This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%.  Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range. \u000a\u000aPlease review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  \u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a\u000a\u000a      \u000a\u000aP.S.   I'm having trouble attaching the drawing.  I will send it under separate cover.\u000a
p4597
aV\u000a\u000aYes, I called <NAME/> <NAME/> from the airport.  What is the amount?  I was not sure from the numbers below.  Please save the detail from my expense account. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4598
aV\u000a\u000aEveryone,\u000a\u000aLooking for a volunteer to market TW to this new power plant so that they will take the supplies off our pipe.  Any takers?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4599
aV\u000a\u000aTiny,\u000a\u000aThanks for the note.  I'll let TK and <NAME/> know that you got the money for the four wheeler.  Along with many, we will miss <NAME/> a lot.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4600
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/> and <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI am not certain that <NAME/> has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (<NAME/> Gadd's group) with respect to the move.  In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with <NAME/> as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in.  <NAME/> will also coordinate <NAME/> Dowd with the rest of <NAME/>'s group in the move so we need to keep a space for him.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aPlease let me know when you have accounted for everyone in <NAME/>'s group (plus <NAME/> Dowd) for the move and have the location assignment.  \u000a\u000a\u000aThe goal for all is that everyone will have a chair when the music stops.  :>)\u000a\u000aThanks to all for your help!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4601
aV\u000a\u000aPlease keep me posted.  I am off next week, but I would like to book lunch with you in the next couple of weeks just to catch up.  Twenty-six floors is too far away from you guys.  What does your calendar look like.  Throw me a couple of dates that may work for you.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000aK.\u000a
p4602
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI hope to have the revised contract for you late tonight.  Would you like to set up a time that <NAME/> and I can go over it with you by telephone?  How about Monday or Tuesday?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4603
aV\u000a\u000aKyle,\u000a \u000aSorry for not sending this yesterday.  Monday's are always tough.  Please review and let me know what you think.  Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday.\u000a \u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4604
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWould you please add <NAME/> Y'Barbo on this distribution list.  <NAME/> is one of our new marketing reps and will be involved with our risk management strategies including our fuel positions and how it relates to this report.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4605
aV\u000a\u000aOh, My Italian Amigos,\u000a\u000aI just received a fax from Hotel Condotti and they do have availability for June 7 & 8 at a rate of Euro 233 ( which is about USD $204) which includes breakfast and taxes.\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://hotelcondotti.com/rooms.html\u000a\u000ahttp://www.hotelfirenzeroma.it/ing/hotel.htm\u000a\u000aPlease check out each of the above web sites and let me know what you think.  The Condotti is a little more expensive, but certainly looks very nice.  We know that Firenze was fine and I'm certainly happy to stay there again if everyone is game.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>, do you have a preference?  <NAME/> please talk with <NAME/> and let me know what your vote is.   Also, let me know if you want me to check on other hotels in Rome.  Once I tally the votes, I'll confirm the hotel.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aP.S.  <NAME/>, you'll have to give me your credit card information.  Call me with this info, do not send email.  (Due to Big E issues, I cannot delete any email messages and I don't want this info hanging around.)\u000a
p4606
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you bring <NAME/>'s laptop back to the office?  I had originally told her we only needed it while you were out with your sinus surgery.  I'd like to go ahead and return it to her.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4607
aV\u000a\u000aTK can sell Feb-Dec to Sid <NAME/> for $2.27.  Or  sell remaining Jan, Feb and March for $2.01.  We can sell 10,000 for Feb/March.  We can look at only selling 5,000 for rest of year, leaving 5,000 to catch upside(or downside).  We need to at least sell Feb/March before 1:00pm AGA report today.  Are you OK with this?\u000a
p4608
aV\u000a\u000aFYI,   <NAME/> Hyatt left me a voicemail last night when he found out about this open season for a new storage facility.  Let's discuss after everyone has a chance to review.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4609
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000aI can make myself available this evening or tomorrow evening to discuss this and other topics as your calendar permits.  I actually think that we should not be pressured by anyone to fill this position in the next few days.  If <NAME/> would like to resign effective the end of the month (or some other date), I think that would be fine.  It is completely reasonable that the board take some amount of time, whatever is necessary, to select the right candidate.  Let me know when you would like to rally.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aP.S.  <NAME/>, congratulations on the new grandbaby!  I hope mom, dad and precious little one are doing well!\u000a
p4610
aV\u000a\u000aTracy,\u000a\u000aGreat job!  We appreciate your persistence in helping to close the gap on these shipper imbalances!  \u000a\u000aMany thanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> :>)\u000a
p4611
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  \u000a\u000aThank you, but I will be out of town on Mon and Tues of next week and will not be available to attend.  I would recommend that <NAME/> Janousek (or Bobby <NAME/>) be aware of this meeting as they might be interested in attending since they are building several other web based tools for us.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4612
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is the Sun Devil Expansion Project information.  Please review and give me a call at your convience to discuss.  We also have some space left from our Red <NAME/> Expansion that we can discuss as well.\u000a\u000aThank you for your interest and I look forward to working with you.\u000a
p4613
aV\u000a\u000aI was informed by Lone Star that they have not completed their transaction with Sid Richardson and they will continue to take deliveries from TW until further notice.  (I suspect that they may not sell this asset, after all.)  Assume no sale for now, I will keep you posted if anything changes.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4614
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is a suggested amendment for our Confidentiality Agreement to allow us to discuss Southern Trails with a potiential partner.  Please feel free to give me a call to discuss.\u000a\u000aMany thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4615
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, would you please check this distribution list and let me know if you think we might have accidentally omitted someone that should have received an invite?  I don't want to leave anyone out that should come.  Thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4616
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aWe are still confirming whether or not TW has had other I to I deals negotiated in the past.  So far, TK, <NAME/> and <NAME/> don't think that we have any, but I will talk to Lindy tomorrow.  Here are some NNG I to I neg. rates that have been approved during the past year.  \u000a\u000aI will keep you posted. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4617
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aFYI, you are more than welcome to join us for this meeting or sit in our new 8:00am meetings starting Tuesday, Jan 22 in EB1336.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4618
aV\u000a\u000aI think she is on vacation most of next week.  Is it possible to talk with <NAME/> or the other assistants to figure out the costs just to have a ball park place holder until <NAME/> comes back?\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere are some of our comments to amend the KMI/TW letter agreement for dates listed in the agreement.  Please review and lets discuss tomorrow morning.  We are putting together a timeline for all of the various things that need to happen which will help us both determine the new dates to put in the letter.  We'll send this to you as soon as we are finish.  \u000a\u000aDo you have any comments on the Pemex letter agreement?\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>.\u000a
p4620
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  all is correct except that <NAME/> <NAME/> should get two flat screens instead of <NAME/> and me getting a third panel.  However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for <NAME/> to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.  Is there an extra one around for her?  \u000a \u000aMany thanks, \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4621
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'm sorry, I was out of the office last week and did not see this email in time.  I think it looks fine.  I saw the final version in the ebiz today.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4622
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI got your "out of the office" message the other day when I emailed you, so I knew you would be busy when you got back in the office.  My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow, my afternoon looks a little better than the morning.  Next week looks wide open.  Would you mind waiting until next week?  I just want to make sure we are not holding you up.  Let me know your preference.  \u000a\u000aBy the way, how did your testimony go on Big Sandy?  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4623
aV\u000a\u000aI agree with you on the <NAME/>.  I'm not sure we should take it out long distance.  If <NAME/> doesn't mind, that would be great.\u000a\u000aILY, K.\u000a

p4628
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.  We had been currently utilizing <NAME/> Treat and <NAME/> Bolks for LIM information.\u000a\u000aShould we coordinate with you?\u000a\u000aPlease advise.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4629
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  \u000a\u000aYikes, I thought you were on eSpeak the following week.  I am in Artesia on Tuesday the 6th and won't be able to help you.  I'll be sure to submit some questions for you to answer.\u000a\u000aSorry, \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> would like to know what our HP is at these units and what type of units are they?  What is the age of the equipment?  Is this something we would be willing to share?  I told him that our run time on these units was less than 1,000 hours.  If we are OK sharing this info, would you either call him or email this to him.  If we don't want to share, just let me know and I would be happy to call him and let him know.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>' phone number is 281-610-1333, his email is john.davis5@worldnet.att.net\u000a
p4632
aV\u000a\u000aLee,\u000a\u000aWell, I'm not crazy, just dumb not to think about looking at all the emails <NAME/> has sent to me.  This is the original language you drafted for me for the Questar amendment.  By the way, I did send them the most recent version you send me which in not as verbose as this version.  Are we still OK? \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4633
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWould you please email me the final bullets from last week.  I don't necessarily go look for the final copy since I am the one who combines all the bullets.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

I also received this message that the recipient below in not known....I do not know who this person is or what/why is was returned to me, so now I am worried that someone was at my computer doing something before the screensaver came on.

Since this gas will only be a San <NAME/> supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.  So, if the TW San <NAME/> pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San <NAME/> Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.  \u000a\u000a\u000aQuestar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,  <NAME/>.\u000a
p4649
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'm back in the office now.  I tried to open this document, but I do not have word perfect.  Can you convert to a Word document and resend for my files?\u000a\u000aMany thanks, <NAME/>\u000a

The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.

aV\u000a\u000aJerry,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> asked me to get with you and coordinate any outage planning input that you need from our group.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4654
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI forgot one thing.  Let Morgan and I know if you get any declines for our session.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4655
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere are the people that will be coming to the data room on Monday:\u000a\u000aL.D.

p4658
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI just ran into Tracy in the hall and she asked if on Trans Pecos the $131MM (or it could be $138MM) represented 100% or 50% of the cost.  The $131 is 100% of the cost of the project.  If we joint venture with KMI, our cost would be half of this.  Call me if you have questions.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4659
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I reviewed my files and did not find the Dandby section.  I don't believe that I looked in the asset book.  Check with <NAME/> Curry - there did seem to be some confusion about the Asset Listing Summary vs. the Asset Listing Detail (that wasn't in the file)  - maybe it is just miss-filed in their stuff.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4660
aV\u000a\u000aHi Dot.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see what she says.\u000a\u000aHappy Thanksgiving.  <NAME/>.\u000a
p4661
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWhen I talked to Kyle last week I didn't realize that you are still driving into downtown everyday.  I have my trunk loaded with some contributions for MANNA and would like to pass them off to you when it is convenient.  What is your schedule during this week?  I could meet you during lunch or at the end of your day any day this week, whatever you prefer.\u000a\u000aMany thanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aP.S.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, FYI, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> and I emailed the Hotel Mozart in Rome for availability.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  \u000a\u000aHave a great day!  K.\u000a
p4663
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks for the message.  In fact, I talked with <NAME/> Hass about this earlier today.  I also talked to Questar about this today as well.  <NAME/> Schmitt was somewhat optimistic, but he had not seen the full order yet so he was still reserved.  I'll keep you posted.  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4664
aV\u000a\u000aWe will meet after the morning meeting tomorrow to discuss these imbalances with Market Services.  If you are available, please plan to attend.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4665
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  thanks for the notice of this meeting.  I'm glad you will be attending.  FYI, the Aquila folks purchased USGT from <NAME/> MacKenzie about 18 months ago and I'm not sure how they have incorporated the USGT organization into the Aquila organization.  Since you are the new kid, perhaps you can inquire as to the differences in these shops so that you can effectively deal with both organizations.  I'm not sure we've ever been clear on this.  Please continue to talk about Red <NAME/> with these folks.  What would Aquila like to see TW offer?  What are their thoughts about the West markets?  What could TW do to get Aquila to be more active on our pipe? \u000a\u000aFYI, I am coming into the office Wed morning.  I will be in EB4179.  I need to meet with <NAME/> and pack up this office.  I should be in by 9:00.  If your schedule permits, perhaps you and I could meet for a few minutes on Agave before your 10:00 Aquila meeting?\u000a\u000aI'll call you when I get in.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI, I am in training tomorrow, Wednesday, from 8:00 until noon in the 3 <NAME/> Center.  I can be reached by my cell phone if you need me.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000acell 713 416 5059\u000a
p4669
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is the pricing information on the DTN feed.  I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.\u000a\u000aThe minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.  Do you want to see the real-time feeds?  It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.  \u000a\u000aPlease let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.  Also, there will be no additional cost to have this on the 13 floor and move it to our final destination (there used to be a large fee for moving locations).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4670
aV\u000a\u000aWe have a floor meeting with <NAME/> on Monday at 1:30 to discuss the Dynegy deal.  See announcement below. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLindy, I just saw this.  Did you know about this meeting?  I hope you were able to attend.  Thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4672
aV\u000a\u000aAlthough we expect to receive specific feedback on our July 6, 2001 proposal to Pemex for the TransPecos Pipeline very soon, we sent the attached letter today to Pemex (with a copy to Kinder Morgan) that will withdraw our proposal on October 1, 2001 if the LOI has not been executed.  \u000a\u000aKinder Morgan has agreed with the sending of this letter.  Pemex has been aware of the contents of this letter since Monday, September 17.\u000a\u000aWe will keep you posted of our detailed discussions with Pemex as they proceed.\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4673
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aHere is the Sun Devil Expansion Package.  Please review and forward on to those in your group who may have an interest.  We would be happy to discuss this expansion opportunity with you at your convenience.\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a<NAME/>.\u000aX33098\u000a
p4674
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aThis recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, <NAME/> <NAME/> (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.\u000a \u000aGood Luck!\u000a \u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4675
aV\u000a\u000aFYI, here is the cancellation of the <NAME/> Hotel.  I hope to hear from the hotel in Positano and Rome (front end trip only) today.  <NAME/>, please confirm the cancellation of your front-end Sheraton hotel in Rome.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4676
aV\u000a\u000aI will be out of town next Friday.  <NAME/> will be attending for our group.  Thank you for the invite.  <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a \u000aYes, I am still here!  However, the Research and Development department is no longer a part of <NAME/> which is why their emails have been returned to you.  Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted. \u000a \u000a<NAME/>.\u000a

p4684
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aFYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.  However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left <NAME/> in June and <NAME/> and <NAME/> moved to <NAME/>'s RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.  <NAME/> and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

p4689
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aWhat are your thoughts on this request?  I'm not even sure that our map department exists because of December 3.  If we respond to her request, we may want someone at an officer level at the Navajo Nation to request this data and then send it directly to the officer.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4690
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aMy apologizes, a slight typo in the Trans Pecos name in last paragraph.  Here is the revised memo.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a

Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4692
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.  I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a
p4693
aV\u000a\u000aFYI - I spoke with <NAME/> Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>.\u000a

They will review and we will plan to meet next Mon or Tues to iron out any remaining items (such as the operatorship) so we can tender to Pemex.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> is OK with them and has agreed that if we need to conceded the operatorship, we can, but he would like an opener in three years to re-bid the operatorship.\u000a

This is one of the recipes that I got in Paris when I went to cooking school.  They translated it for us, but as you can imagine, it needs just a little bit of discussion to fill in the blanks.  I hope I'm not scaring you, it is actually a pretty easy recipe.  \u000a \u000aMy home number is 713 791 9201 and my office number is 713 853 3098.\u000a \u000aThanks, <NAME/>.   :>)\u000a

p4711
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  \u000a\u000aI am out of town beginning this evening and returning home Tuesday night.  Perhaps we can catch up sometime later this week. It looks like <NAME/> wants to transition out soon. \u000a\u000aHave a great week.  Thanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4712
aV\u000a\u000aI checked with our Travel Agency and they cannot secure cheaper tickets than what we are seeing on the internet.  It looks like $1,100 - $1,200 is about the price for the <NAME/> to Rome roundtrip.\u000a\u000aFYI, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4713
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aWe need an earlier time on Monday to have the prep meeting for Trans Pecos (it is currently scheduled for 1:30).  Can you tell me what <NAME/>'s calendar looks like?  Our meeting with <NAME/> is at 3:30.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

p4715
aV\u000a\u000ayes, I got it when I returned.  I think the away status just lets you know that I may not reply instantly.  K.\u000a
p4716
aV\u000a\u000aNo problem, it will be nice to visit with him.\u000a\u000aK.\u000a\u000aPS.  Does this mean that I will be in the back seat of the convertable?  If so, I'm afraid we will have to ride with the top up.\u000a
p4717
aV\u000a\u000aWhat were the offer dates for the Gormet Group?  Didn't we offer all three weekends?  I'm open all three weekends in November, however, we might want to steer clear of the 17 just incase we decide to travel during the week of Thanksgiving.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4718
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000aI've been out of town this week, but I did want you to know that I received your message.  <NAME/> Fegan is our HR rep and she can help you and <NAME/> coordinate the paperwork.  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYou are going to have such a great time!  Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves.  You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings.  A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine.  Is your jacket water wary?  Tennis shoes are definitely OK!\u000a\u000aYou will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh.  Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town.  Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town).  Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start.  Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!\u000a\u000aCall me when you get back.  I'd love to hear all about your trip!\u000a\u000aHugs back at you, <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aP.S.  Stay away from Haggus(spelling?).\u000a

p4729
aV\u000a\u000aFYI....\u000a\u000aI believe <NAME/> N. and <NAME/> had a conversation regarding help in the risk mgmt area.  I saw <NAME/> in the hallway earlier and he indicated that he wanted to rally with you and me to discuss. \u000aI've got two calls into <NAME/> Armstrong with SW Gas.  I hope to get him to send in a request this week.  Also, <NAME/> has been running numbers today, so I should have a term sheet for you tomorrow.  \u000aThe Agave Christmas Party is on Tuesday, December 11.

p4732
aV\u000a\u000aHey guys and girls,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate response from the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.  I believe it is a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).  From the article in my book, they have recently remodeled.  They are located near our Hotel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza <NAME/> Popolo.  The rate is 430,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we won't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancellation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says they have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cancellation with our reservation. \u000a\u000aI think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the others, if at all.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know your thoughts ASAP. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4733
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere are my bullets for the week. <NAME/> may have one more bullet to add to the Current Week Activity section if she closes her deal for September with Burlington.  \u000a\u000aThanks, I'll give you a call somewhere along the road.  <NAME/>\u000a
p4734
aV\u000a\u000aAll,\u000a\u000aPlease review and call your customers if they have not paid their invoice.  Keep Market Services plugged into your conversations with the customer. \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a
p4735
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  \u000a\u000aI am flying Monday evening.  I will check on my flight time and will call in if I can.  What is the phone number to this conference room?  \u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

p4738
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>,  \u000a\u000aI would be happy to call in with you on your first "on call" weekend if you would like.  <NAME/>, your weekend comes up this next weekend, I will plan to call in on Sat and Sun with you.  <NAME/> will send you an email with the total list of everyone calling in including the phone number to dial into.  Make sure you locate this list prior to the weekend.  Remember, call in about 5-7 minutes before 8:00am Sat and Sun.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a

I have a 10:00 meeting, so I will have to run soon.  I'll call you when I get back.\u000a\u000aI'm still OK taking off tomorrow and next week.

aV\u000a\u000aMy Italian Amigos,\u000a\u000aI have just received a fax from the Marincanto Hotel, Positano.  They do have availability for us beginning May 25 for 3 nights.  They have at least one standard double room (sea view) for Euro 186 (approximately $165 USD) and one superior double room (also sea view) for Euro 217 ( approximately $192 USD).  The only difference between the rooms that I can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath.  I do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located.  This hotel has a private beach (I think I read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach) with a private descent (Wahoo!).  They also have private parking at the cheap price of Euro 18 per day and only a thousand (uphill each way) steps to it.  \u000a\u000aIs this hotel still OK?  I do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available.  Please let me know what your preference is.  I can clarify in my next fax.  If both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each, shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest?\u000a\u000aAlso, there was one other hotel in Positano that I looked into before finding Hotel Marincanto for our Sept. trip but they were full.  I may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare.\u000a\u000aPlease advise.\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aP.S.  We also have a fax from Hotel Firenze in Rome that we are confirmed for June 7 & 8!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIn order to expedite getting Non-Disclosure Agreements (Confidentiality Agreements) in place, it would expedite matters if the <NAME/> Credit Inc. followed the following procedures:\u000a\u000a1.  Send all requests for NDAs by email directly to me, <NAME/> Jones\u000a2.  The email should contain the correct legal name of the company and its address\u000a3.  I will need a brief description of the nature of the business/project you are discussing with the customer\u000a4.  Generally we will send out a bilateral NDA, but there are instances where only <NAME/> is providing confidential information, and we prefer to use that form whenever possible as it is much more favorable to <NAME/>.  Please indicate when you think you have such a situation.\u000a5.  We have found it most helpful to send the NDAs to the counterparties by email directly from Legal.  I have a email letter that states:  "At the request of "dealmaker name" I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement. If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by <NAME/>.  If you have any comments or questions please call <NAME/> Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-3397 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you."  If you prefer, we can email the NDA to you to go out under you cover letter, or send it by fax or UPS.  Just let me know and I will do so.  Otherwise, I will email it as it speeds things up.\u000a6.  Please indicate any special timing concerns (i.e., it needs to go out today, by lunch, we have a meeting Wednesday, whatever).  Generally they go out within 1-2 days of receipt of your email.\u000a\u000aUpon receipt of this information I will do the conflicts check, prepare the NDA, and log the NDA into the list I keep of the <NAME/> Credit Inc. NDAs.  I hope this will make for a smooth process!  Thanks for your assistance.\u000a

p4837
aV\u000a\u000aBranches:  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party, which under ISDA can ONLY be a bank.\u000a\u000aRestrictions:  Things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading, payment/settlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it.  It is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff.  Examples would be:  "masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only", "no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions", "no oral trades allowed", "only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company", "all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures".  You can do a sort on the PENDING SWAP UPDATE - EXECUTED, which will then show you all the restrictions, then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions.  But we don't want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff.  Just critical, DON'T TRADE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THIS STUFF.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.\u000a\u000aIs there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.  They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI had a conversation with Belco prior to the receipt of the documents <NAME/> forwarded on down to you.  I think before we make any response in the nature of what you are discussing below I think we might want to have a meeting or get <NAME/> involved because that is not what Belco has in mind at all.  Although I understand from <NAME/> Credit's point of view Belco is not longer in the drivers seat with respect to the Belco/Westport relationship, I think we still need to tread gingerly with how we deal with Belco or <NAME/> Lay might be getting a phone call from Mr. Belfer (and I don't want my name to be brought up in that conversation!).  When you get back in the office let's pow-wow about how to approach this.\u000a
p4846

I have asked <NAME/> <NAME/> in our Credit Dept. here to get with the credit person there in London who worked up the credit worksheet to clear up the credit terms.  I have drafted the ISDA with everything except making the credit choices so it sits there waiting for credit.\u000a\u000aJust wanted to keep you updated...\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThey are settled, but not executed.  We have sent the ETA amendment out to the DB lawyer for signature, but we have not gotten it back signed.  I'll give here a call.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe have three areas currently reserved for our bidders, what we will call Teams A, B & C.  The room situation is as follows:\u000a\u000aTeam A:  Main Conference Room 2991 = working phone\u000a              Satellite Breakout Rooms, 2992 & 2993 \u000a              \u000a	There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supplies or office supplies\u000a\u000aTeam B:  Main Conference Room 32c2\u000a               Satellite Breakout Rooms 3260 and Conference Room (unmarked) to the left thereof \u000a\u000a             Currently no working phones in this area.  There are no coffee thermos's, cups, supllies or office supplies\u000a\u000aTeam C:  Main Conference Room 3371 = has working phone.\u000a              Satellite Breakout Room 3376 = no working phone.\u000a\u000a                         Has coffee thermos's & some coffee cups & supplies, needs office supplies.\u000a\u000a\u000a           I just met at noon with <NAME/> <NAME/> who handles, phones, faxes & furniture (x54423) and he is working on getting us phones, a fax machine, a non-network printer, and at least one laptop computer portal in each Team area.  After looking at the areas,  <NAME/> thought the easiest Team area to have completed FIRST would be the 29th floor area (it seems to have the right computer/phone jacks) WHICH HE WILL TRY TO GET COMPLETED BY THE END OF TODAY.  SECOND, we will target the 32nd floor.\u000a\u000aWe have a fourth area available after this for Team D:  a suite of smaller offices/conference rooms also located on 29, in 2945, 2946, 2947, and around the corner in 2940.  2946, a smaller office has a workable phone there, <NAME/>. We would need other phones installed there as well other the other equipment.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis cpy was on the 10/5/01 list with a note "replacing profile for BP Exploration & Oil Inc."  We've got a few issues here.  First, we just can replace profiles.  If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.\u000a\u000aWhat's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you?\u000a
p4876
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is additional  correspondence from TransAlta re: the merger and guaranty info I sent you on 10/5/01.  Can you please contact TransAlta and let them know you will be handling this.  Thanks.\u000a
p4877
aV\u000a\u000aI wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as <NAME/> approves the changes.  Dealing with Japan is somewhat time challenging.\u000a
p4878
aV\u000a\u000aDo any of you have any problems with keeping these trades as they are now that we've figured out what they are.  If not we'll just keep them as they were...\u000a
p4879
aV\u000a\u000aWe are waiting for <NAME/> Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  <NAME/> is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.\u000a\u000aHOW GOES IT MARK????\u000a
p4880
aV\u000a\u000aAt the request of <NAME/> Smith, I am attaching our proposed form of Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by <NAME/>.  If you have any comments or questions please call <NAME/> Koehler, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-3448 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.\u000a
p4881
aV\u000a\u000aI have reviewed the binder of confirms and have prepared a list of the missing or unexecuted confirms.  <NAME/>. if you could please review this short list and provide me copies of the missing confirms and/or if we have received copies of any of the unexecuted confirms since you provided these confirms to me I would be most appreciative.\u000a
p4882
aV\u000a\u000aIt appears that the fax you moved in on the 33rd floor was actively being used by <NAME/> Tholan and his assistant on that floor (x58889).  Can your people please move it back ASAP and find us another one.  Thanks.\u000a
p4883
aV\u000a\u000aWe also have lots of agreements between internal counterparties. \u000a\u000aI also owe you more comments...I haven't forgotten...\u000a
p4884
aV\u000a\u000aYou do not have to grant Nakesha access.  She already has view only access as does any <NAME/> employee.  If you show her how to set up an icon to get into the database, she should be able to get view access to the database.  All <NAME/> employees have view access.  Only employees of Legal and Credit can have edit access access.  Does that help?\u000a
p4885
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Koehler & I had a quick call w/<NAME/> Glass.  Thanks for his name.  We are going to include arbitration, though the ICC rules not our standard AAA (since we don't have the "Paris" language).  And NY law.  Otherwise, I'm just waiting on your FCPA language.  I also heard back from Justy.\u000a\u000aThanks for your help.  I really appreciate it!\u000a
p4886
aV\u000a\u000aThis counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.  You wre checking on their ability to trade power.  Any update?\u000a
p4887
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is a list of the Termination Letters I have been able to locate so far.  <NAME/> suggested that Bear Stearns termination is just a close-out of a NYMEX margin position and I have a call into <NAME/> Whiting to see if that is the case.\u000a\u000aI spoke to <NAME/> Breslau about the Pemex termination and he knows nothing about that.  He said if it happened it would have gone thru his desk.  What are your thoughts on that?\u000a\u000aThere appear to be two International Paper Deals.  <NAME/> Breslau got me a signed copy of the one terminating the deal for $12,163,283.  There was another International Paper deal the Confirmation Desk prepared a termination for in the amount of $1,311,164.  <NAME/>, any knowledge of this other one?\u000a\u000aNo copy either of the executed terminations of the Proctor & Gamble deals the Confirmation Desk prepared for (i) deal no. Y 49018.1 for $81,083, and (ii) deal no. 49011.1 for $442,000.\u000a\u000aThat just leaves the Socal-JP Morgan on <NAME/>'s list with no copy.\u000a
p4888
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aBy copy of this email, I am asking <NAME/> Panus, another Paralegal in our group, to handle this for you as I am on working on a special project this week.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, per <NAME/>'s voicemail, Cinergy is very interested in getting a financial master in place to trade with us ASAP.  Can you please give their attorney a call.  <NAME/>, you forgot Mr. Gollomp's phone number.\u000a
p4889
aV\u000a\u000aI also got an email back from <NAME/> <NAME/>, head of Credit that siad this doesn't make sense.  Maybe you need to prepare a print out of the trades and send to debbie, me & bill.\u000a

p4892
aV\u000a\u000aI spoke to <NAME/> Taylor and we would like <NAME/> removed from this corporation as well.  We can date this revocation effective as of 10/1/01 as well.  We really appreciate your help with these resolutions.  I am circulating the EPMI resolution and will forward it to you as soon as it is fully executed.\u000a
p4893
aV\u000a\u000aPlease remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:\u000a\u000a1.  "executed"\u000a2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master\u000a3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it\u000a4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master\u000a5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement\u000a\u000aThanks for your attention herewith.\u000a

p4898
aV\u000a\u000aPls do not restrict my ability to kill my career.... the problem with me sending this note internally is that they would probably want to hire the writer of this note to help restructure some of our outstanding agreements.\u000a

p4907
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I was looking at that pricing sheet and would like to suggest that the shading in the commentary boxes... under the assumption that this becomes a printed document and that it is printed in black & white, it is very difficult to read. Perhaps a more solid background would work better.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aEntering into term agreements with <NAME/> today is probably not the best play until our credit / restructuring issues are resolved.  What are you thinking about? \u000a\u000aAll is fine, hanging in there, pissed off like you would not believe... but not much I can do now but wait it out.. I have very little interest moving back to canada at this time so it should be interesting. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4912
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I was talking to <NAME/> Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO <NAME/> Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with <NAME/> Fielder.  \u000a \u000aFor sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? \u000a \u000aIt is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. \u000a \u000aDo you know the CFO ? \u000a \u000aregards, BT\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMeeting with PG&E went OK... they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.  PROGRESS I guess.... \u000a\u000aFlights were good.. got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day... \u000a\u000aIF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on.. .that would be great. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, my marketer out of the Portland office had word that a EES marketer ( <NAME/> Dickinson ) was looking to contact a Utility in the Northwest.... the reason that EES was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and EES would help them create or structure ..\u000a\u000aThis marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help. \u000a\u000aRegardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts.... Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider them a primary wholesale customer.\u000a\u000aI have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.\u000a\u000aPls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.\u000a\u000aregards, \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

You and I need to hook up on Monday to discuss plan of attack regarding gas and as per your original message I agree with you, it starts with some basic discussions around their intent, vs trying to bang out a Master agreement that may go no where. \u000a\u000aTalk to you today I hope. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p4925
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, as I read this e-mail i cringe at the thought that we have been dancing around this issue for  4 months yet all around us we will be laying off some very good employees who really deserve to be here, and more importantly, want to be here.\u000a\u000aPlenty of time has been given to this issue..... please fix as soon as possible.

p4953
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for looking after this.  I am not as interested in who or how we spent the money, but more so on where our estimates were off.  The whole reason for setting up and getting approval is being accountable to the plan. \u000a\u000aGive me a call.... when you have a moment. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4954
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release ( purchase or sale ) at full tolls, discount or premium. In addition to this and most importantly what is ENA's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement. I.E. if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer ( at full tolls ) are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4955
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, further to our conversation of yesterday... here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the <NAME/> office.  In all cases, if <NAME/>'s group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per <NAME/>'s note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San <NAME/> producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the <NAME/> office as we had always planned.\u000a\u000aPls review and advise if you need anything further. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice, we will suspend interviews and discussions.  <NAME/> does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time, priorities lie elsewhere! \u000a\u000aPls contact me if there are any questions, otherwise can you coordinate with <NAME/> Buckley ( et al ).

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. \u000a\u000aOnce things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.\u000a\u000aLooking forward to those discussions. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4982
aV\u000a\u000amarge, I went in and registered but my name is coming up as a director... should be a V.P.... I don't really care but if you are updating files pleas have this changed.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Tycholiz\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThat was pretty funny.... he is doing research on NW utilities, however that is not their mandate to market to them... so I say, then why are you doing research... he say's ... " I'm not... who said I was"... it was about that time I started to laugh... oh well.\u000a
p4984
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/>.... I talked to <NAME/> this a.m. regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for PG&E. He said he would review Post Petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to PG&E. He was going to discuss internally and advise.\u000a\u000aI am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds, so this may conflict with the timelines <NAME/> and I discussed this a.m.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4985
aV\u000a\u000aAssuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do? \u000a\u000aI am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. \u000a\u000aSo, can you pls advise. \u000a\u000aI would suggest we get Suncor to give you a "Stand Still" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.\u000a\u000a\u000aCurrent economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.\u000a\u000aNone of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ). \u000a\u000aGive me a call. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... \u000a\u000aLet's discuss needs...\u000a\u000aPerhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p4991
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.\u000a\u000aDo you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As <NAME/> indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'\u000a\u000aThere is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! \u000a\u000aAny thoughts.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4992
aV\u000a\u000aPls coordinate a vacation schedule planner for me for all of the staff from now until the end of the year ( including Jan ).  Pls include <NAME/>\u000a\u000aBT.\u000a
p4993
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, just wanted you to know that I have decided to NOT offer <NAME/> a rotation in west gas and I have talked to him this a.m.\u000a\u000aAs discussed, I like his basic skill sets but I decided this a.m. to hold off for the next 2 weeks or so before filling any spots for the end of the year.  I am sure he will find a good rotation, just wasn't the best fit for me at this time.\u000a\u000aThanks, BT\u000a
p4994
aV\u000a\u000aGood morning... There is NO issue on your e-mail that is going to get in the way of Family issues... so don't worry about that. <NAME/>'t knee cap the band because you guys owe me $ 4,000.00.  I was just checking on what your decision was... keep me posted. \u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4995
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?  It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term. ( winter Gas).  You would think that they would be fine with loading up on <NAME/>. Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!! \u000a\u000aWith regards to a meeting.... I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. \u000a\u000aI think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal.  I will call you today. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p4996
aV\u000a\u000acall me in a few minutes... to discuss BP discussions.\u000a
p4997
aV\u000a\u000aAs you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. \u000a\u000aAlthough not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  \u000a\u000aAs we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI tried to call you last night around 6:00.  I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.  Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans.. I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never... SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.  \u000a \u000aCall me this a.m. \u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5000
aV\u000a\u000aI would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount... 10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5001
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I believe that your total loss payable equates to $55.00. <NAME/> and I netted out  so you can pay me directly.\u000a\u000aThanks, BT\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, thanks for seeing us this week. \u000a\u000aI am working internally to get our corporation over the top on the primary contractual and credit issues and believe I am making progress. I shall get back to you soonest.   \u000a\u000aCan you please advise as to the payables policy of DWR. For example, if I were to sell you gas via <NAME/> Online for the month of November, would DWR be paying that invoice on the 25th of the month following delivery? \u000a\u000aIs there any possibility that this could get paid on the 5th of the month following delivery( at least in the beginning).\u000a\u000aThanks in advance, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Tycholiz\u000a

p5005
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. \u000a\u000aHaving them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have <NAME/> or <NAME/> call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.\u000a\u000aThanks, BT\u000a

p5008
aV\u000a\u000aSteph, what do you think about RFPing the PGT capacity if and when we get a standstill from Suncor...I was thinking we could send to SMUD, Morgan <NAME/>, Calpine, perhaps avista.  It might be a bit radical... but perhaps can drive out the highest value.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5009
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I lost my cell phone the other day... as such, can you please forward to me <NAME/>'s Cell phone, and work #'s to re-install. \u000a\u000aThanks.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

For a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but I know that from a Trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing. \u000a\u000aMy groups interests are around transportation, risk management, Strategic Assets, storage etc... .items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue.  \u000a\u000aWe spend a lot of time on fundamentals, research, hedging strategies, load forecasting etc.\u000a\u000aYou had mentioned being in town in early November and if your schedule allows I would welcome the chance to get together.\u000a\u000aPlease contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim.... if I end up in the city prior to the end of the month, I may try to contact you then.\u000a\u000aThanks in advance. \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Tycholiz\u000aVice President\u000a<NAME/> North America\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest.  You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.   \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Lucci ( <NAME/> office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. <NAME/>, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    \u000a\u000aAt a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - <NAME/> will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.\u000a\u000aCall if you guys want to discuss. \u000a\u000aregard,  BT\u000a

However, for the purposes of PGT ( at this time ), I would ask that you continue on your path of resolution. \u000a \u000aI will follow up with Canada this a.m. to ascertain what they have done with the NOVA and ANG portions. \u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  \u000a\u000aI am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.\u000a\u000aPls keep me posted. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5063
aV\u000a\u000aFurther to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  \u000a\u000aAny curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. \u000a\u000aIn addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by <NAME/> Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.\u000a\u000aI trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..\u000a\u000aPls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p5084
aV\u000a\u000aLorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices  and load.  As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.\u000a\u000aPls review and we can discuss at your convenience.\u000a\u000aAlso, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.\u000a\u000aregards, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Tycholiz\u000a

The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. \u000a\u000a2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of " Payment " from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. \u000a\u000aPls advise if either of these points capture your interest. \u000a\u000aThanks in advance, \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Tycholiz\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? \u000a\u000aIn aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. \u000a\u000aAlso, pls verify who has cell phones in <NAME/> and what the monthly bills look like for this office.\u000a\u000aThanks, BT\u000a
p5091
aV\u000a\u000aAs we had talked about yesterday.... any deals cut by El Paso are going to be opposed by the shippers ( when it comes to adding new capacity or expanding ) until the existing issues are resolved.).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5092
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, can you add the cash and rest of month price for <NAME/> Hub onto your daily pricing sheet. I think the cash to futures spreads for pretty relevant in today's market place as the cash market continues to trade well below futures.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks, BT\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ai'm at a loss on calpine also -- seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building -- seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line -- i dont know - just a thought -- the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me.\u000a
p5107
aV\u000a\u000ai guess i need access to view the site with the p/l, that is, if i am supposed to have it.\u000a

Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that <NAME/> is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur" \u000a \u000a \u000ahmmmmmmmmmm.........\u000a

p5119
aV\u000a\u000ahey - seems like we arent the only ones that think kyle is an arrogant asshole anymore - susan told me that on saturday night she had it out with him and doesnt want him around -- also, apparently he's been treating dana like shit and it's starting to get noticed by other people -- just thought this was an interesting development.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000asee - great minds think alike ----- also - check this out ---- from corporate security\u000aLate on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the <NAME/> Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the <NAME/> Center still further.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI spoke with <NAME/> Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  <NAME/> would like for <NAME/> Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through <NAME/> Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.\u000a\u000aENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> this helps.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.\u000a\u000a(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?\u000a\u000a(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a

Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). \u000a\u000aOr is our focus still only gas and power?

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aThe customers appearing on <NAME/>'s list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by <NAME/> for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  <NAME/> has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:\u000a\u000a	Sempra Energy Trading Corp.

Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.\u000a\u000aI also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.\u000a\u000aFurther, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.\u000a\u000aCan you give this a quick review?

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aI wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.\u000a\u000aI have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:\u000a(1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date\u000a(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed\u000a(3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).\u000a(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. \u000a\u000aRegarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.\u000a\u000aRegards.  <NAME/>\u000a

The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by <NAME/> DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. \u000a\u000aIn that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks.  <NAME/>\u000a

p5358
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aI do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  \u000a\u000a(1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?\u000a\u000a(2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)\u000a\u000a(3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.\u000a\u000a(4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?\u000a\u000a(5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?\u000a\u000a(6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:\u000a\u000a"Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."\u000a\u000aThis means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?\u000a\u000a(6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."\u000a\u000a(7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?\u000a\u000a(8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>:\u000a\u000aLegal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.\u000a\u000a(1)  At the request of Chase and with <NAME/>'s approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]\u000a\u000a(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.\u000a\u000a(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.\u000a\u000a(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.\u000a\u000a(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.\u000a\u000aOn a different note,\u000a\u000a(5)  Morgan <NAME/> Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that <NAME/> Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.\u000a\u000a(6)  Both ENA and <NAME/> Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan <NAME/> Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.\u000a\u000a(7)  The names "Morgan <NAME/> & Co., Inc." and "Morgan <NAME/> & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.\u000a\u000aQUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  \u000a\u000aQUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?\u000a\u000aSorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.\u000a

Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from <NAME/> Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return <NAME/>'s message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.\u000a\u000aJust copy me in case I receive a call.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI had a long conversation with <NAME/> Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con <NAME/> ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated <NAME/>ison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  <NAME/> is preparing a new version.\u000a\u000aWe have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, <NAME/> and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to <NAME/>) you should probably call Triche <NAME/> right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:\u000a\u000a(1)	credit event upon merger:  Con <NAME/> coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con <NAME/> rejects ENA's proposal\u000a\u000a(2)	Con <NAME/> is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.\u000a\u000a(3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)\u000a\u000a(4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's\u000a\u000a(5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con <NAME/> wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.\u000a\u000a(6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral\u000a\u000a(7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con <NAME/> will propose that with respect to ENA, only <NAME/> Corp. can hold collateral and <NAME/> Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB\u000a\u000a(8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC\u000a\u000aGiven my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  <NAME/>, will you be handling both Con <NAME/> entities?\u000a
p5414
aV\u000a\u000afyi - I don't have any idea if this will be routed in accordance with the "process" for ENA brokerage agreements\u000a\u000aDo you care?  This is the second such brokerage agreement coming from <NAME/>.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p5436
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aI've just reviewed this credit worksheet for a first draft ISDA.  Is this the type of counterparty for which a "regulatory out" MAC provision is appropriate?

p5439
aV\u000a\u000aEven though we have already terminated this counterparty, I received a voice mail today (caller did not leave name ) for a commercial person to contact the company to discuss a settlement proposal.  The phone number is 303-978-4965.  The termination was not mentioned.\u000a
p5440
aV\u000a\u000aPer my vague voice mail, please open the attached document (Terms of Business) and look at page 12, Paragraph 20 (Jurisdiction).  This is the paragraph I am inquiring about.\u000a\u000aThanks, as usual.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an <NAME/> Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that <NAME/> Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, <NAME/> Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  \u000a\u000aJoe, I believe that <NAME/> may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.\u000a

I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  <NAME/> and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and Bjorn:  Can you provide a <NAME/> with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  Can you provide <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?\u000a\u000aIf the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.\u000a\u000aThanks.

aV\u000a\u000aAll:\u000a\u000aI am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.\u000a\u000aIn the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.\u000a\u000aHow do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?\u000a\u000aPlease let me know.  Thanks.\u000a
p5463
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the list which I created when <NAME/> left town on August 31.  He sent a rash of emails to me (from Stacy) and I assigned per the list.

Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.\u000a\u000aWe have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.

This is the most urgent matter.\u000a\u000aWith respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.\u000a\u000aCan you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aJust wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.  The major changes are credit related:  raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.\u000a\u000aWhenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).

The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.\u000a\u000aAlthough we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?\u000a
p5499
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aAre you alright with AIG disclosing transaction terms to a third party as a possible assignee of those trades?  If so, <NAME/> and I can have the confidentiality provisions of the GTC's waived for this purpose and we can proceed.  \u000a\u000aThanks.  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRude-Dog, <NAME/> is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.  Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4 hours a day are over.  \u000a\u000aI am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  <NAME/> <NAME/>, even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows <NAME/> more room to work.  He is very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> my words, <NAME/> Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.\u000a\u000aThe game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be the one wearing burnt orange.\u000a\u000aG$\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is the form of Master Firm Agreement for ENA and ENA Upstream.  Could you please fill in the Notice Info for ENA Upstream.  Thought it would probably be the same as ENA, but didn't want to assume that.  Once you return to me, I will prepare two executables for signature.  Thanks.\u000a
p5512
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I made a few slight changes to the agreement.  Nothing substantive, just to clarify and catch some typos.  I am OK with this form.  We need to make sure the Universal signs any schedules to this agreement which specify the operating parameters of the units.  Also, <NAME/> <NAME/> will need to review the insurance section and address how we handle their self insurance issues.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.

aV\u000a\u000aAttached is a clean version of the LOI.  I only revised what was paragraph 6.  I tried to redline, but it picked up all the previous changes.\u000a
p5521
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed <NAME/>, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  <NAME/>, can locate these originals.\u000a\u000aI am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.

p5543
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.\u000a \u000aI am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>,  do you want to set something up a call with <NAME/> and his attorney to discuss these issues?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  <NAME/> Braband had approved those agreements.  I know that the El Paso pipelines are very strict on any changes to the GISB form.  I did discuss removal of Section 3.2(b) for Mojave pipeline (an El Paso pipeline) and their attorney agreed.  Unfortunately he only handles the EP Pipelines in the west.  Might be worth another run at their legal to see if we can modify the GISB to meet our template.  Let me know if I can help.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDeb,  Could you pull data sheets for me on the following entities:\u000a\u000aLouisiana Resources Company\u000aLRCI, Inc.\u000aLouisiana Gas Marketing Company\u000aLGMI, Inc.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per <NAME/> <NAME/>'s email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I forwarded the email to you earlier.\u000a\u000aConcerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked <NAME/> Badder's to check with Gulf to obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we have to <NAME/>.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given <NAME/>'s email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!  Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and drink all that beer.\u000a\u000aThe Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.  I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.  After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.  All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  See attached with my changes.  <NAME/>, Can you provide the information <NAME/> needs for Bridgeline.  Thanks.\u000a
p5558
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is our response to Bridgeline's issue list (revised based on our meeting) with a short cover letter.  I addressed the cover letter from you to <NAME/> Morgan.

p5560
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted <NAME/> Pena with El Paso to discuss.  He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.  He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads "Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by <NAME/> North America Corp." is a note which should be stricken.\u000a\u000aAlso for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  \u000a\u000aLastly,  the full legal name "<NAME/> North America Corp." should be inserted in the agreement.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you have any questions.\u000a
p5561
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, Below is the revised language for the restriction on activities paragraph in the Cash Sale Form\u000a\u000aThe Property is restricted in that no activity using explosives or other high-power detonating devices may be conducted on the Property within 500 feet of the storage well facility of Vendor located near the Property that would fracture or cause subsurface movement to the storage well facility of Vendor.  Additionally, Buyer shall erect and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, a suitable chain-link fence between Vendor's retained adjacent property and the purchased Property.\u000a
p5562
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use the counterparties paper.\u000a
p5563
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the review performed so far on the gas contract list you forwarded.  I only reviewed the physical master from <NAME/>'s list.  The attached also included some contracts that <NAME/> asked for review.  I will have more updates tomorrow.\u000a

p5565
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is the letter with a few comments.  The only substantive comment concerns cost tracking.

p5569
aV\u000a\u000aI am OK with the matrix.  Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by <NAME/> and Counterparties.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals?\u000a
p5570
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:\u000a\u000aAll these contracts are in <NAME/> North America Corp.'s name\u000a\u000a1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.\u000a\u000a	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.\u000a\u000a2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  \u000a\u000a	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). \u000a\u000a3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.\u000a\u000a	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). \u000a\u000a4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.\u000a\u000a	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.\u000a
p5571
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Can you please prepare the form of CA we have used before for <NAME/> Compression Services Company based on the information provide by <NAME/> below.  Thanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following\u000a\u000a1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000\u000a    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.\u000a\u000aSection 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in <NAME/>'s well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.\u000a\u000a2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40\u000a     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)\u000a\u000aSection 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from <NAME/>'s new well and a corresponding credit back to <NAME/> for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from <NAME/>.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from <NAME/>'s new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.\u000a\u000a3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500\u000a\u000aI find no basis for this in the contract.\u000a\u000a\u000aUnder Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  \u000a\u000aLet me know if you have any questions.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with <NAME/> earlier, and the concept that <NAME/> Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI don't think there would be any problem with the ECS selling the gas to a third party.  They are currently selling the gas to ENA.  I am not sure how the proceeds from the sale will be handled once ECS recieves them, since ECS is not bankrupt.  I will see if I can find anything out about that.  <NAME/>, you might want to check with <NAME/> and see if he has any insight.\u000a
p5598
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  <NAME/> Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for <NAME/> Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.

I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.  \u000a\u000aDid you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!\u000a\u000aYep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the luster is lost.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.  I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.  With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Please revise the document to reflect Item 1 below.  With respect to Item 2, our environmental group is reviewing <NAME/>'s use of the property.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  To follow up on our discussion last week, <NAME/> Compression Services Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas under its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company.  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW's system as consideration for ECS delivery of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA under a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been desperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipeline worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,000 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a long term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (approximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the current situation.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI actually found a copy yesterday and forwarded to <NAME/> for him to review.  I think we either want a cashier check or a wire transfer.  Do we have a legal description for these tracts to use in the sale documents?  We will need to have one to finalize the documents.\u000a
p5621
aV\u000a\u000aNo.  This must be the Pulp & Paper GTC to which they are referring.  They didn't specifically note it as a gas deal.  Thanks for your help.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/> Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,  How is it going? Did you survive your long run this weekend?  It has been pretty crazy here since I got back.  I really need to start focusing more on the guitar so I can become rich and famous and not have to deal with all this.  I am so tired.\u000a
p5630
aV\u000a\u000aI don't know the status of the Crawfish documents.  I will have to check.  <NAME/> <NAME/> Hooser was handling those documents.  With respect to your previous question, the PSA for the Napoleonville warehouse went to the Assumption Parish last week.\u000a

p5636
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.

p5640
aV\u000a\u000aSounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.  I consistently lose money when I gamble.   \u000a \u000a Do you have Tristan's email address?  Wanted to see if we could hook up in <NAME/> for some Longhorn celebration.\u000a
p5641
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I didn't find any gas agreements in the binders that I have.  Most likely since it was done intra-ENA, there was no contract and it was simply booked under a deal ticket.  I will look to see if I can find any paper in our global database for the deal.\u000a
p5642
aV\u000a\u000aHey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.  The GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the <NAME/> II.  They were both pretty cool.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  With respect to the Transactions for <NAME/> and Public Service Company, <NAME/> prefers to use the Firm General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement for these deals.  These two transactions are 3 month firm deals.  The GISB is not set up for firm transactions longer than 1 month in term.  There is no termination payment provision in a GISB and <NAME/> requires this language for any firm deal.  <NAME/>'s general policy is not to use the GISB for any firm deal that is longer than 1 month. I would be happy to discuss this further at your convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi Mom,  I am doing fine.  Sorry I haven't responded earlier.  Glad to hear that ya'll are back safe and sound.  I am staying busy with the usual stuff.  Talked to <NAME/> last week.

p5656
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is the revised  CSI CA based on our discussion.  The non-compete provision is removed.  As we discussed they would still be obligated to not use our Confidential Information for any purpose other than to evaluate a transaction with ECS.  However, they could still pitch a proposal not utilize our Confidential Information.\u000a
p5657
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is the amendment to the Dow Brine Agreement which extend the period from 160 to 190 days.  I used an amendment form instead of a letter form for the sake of clarity.  Sorry for the delay.\u000a

p5665
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Could you please review the attached.  The documents are for access to a commodities and derivative products online exchange.  ENA Upstream Company, LLC is the <NAME/> entity needing access.  The last directive I received it that all these types of documents for trading platforms needed to be reviewed by you.  Let me know if I am mistaken.  Thanks.\u000a
p5666
aV\u000a\u000aFYI,  Attached is the form of lease agreement that Hanover has forwarded for our lease of the compression equipment from Hanover on the Oakhill deal.  This is actually GE Capital's form of lease agreement, but would be executed between Hanover and <NAME/> Compression Services Company.  Please review and provide any comments you may have.\u000a

p5670
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I am fine with the changes.  Just insert the langauge into the confirm under the heading "Processing".\u000a
p5671
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is the Pioneer Confirm.  Please insert all the relevant contact information.  Also please carefully review the confirm to make sure that I interpreted your email info. correctly.  I left a blank for the Field information.  I would ask the counterparty to fill in and return a copy to ENA Upstream.\u000a
p5672
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Per our discussion, attached is a draft form of gathering agreement.  This form is a firm committed reserves gathering agreement. If the gathering deal is an interruptible type structure, this form would not work.  For use by Crescendo, this form will also need to be scrubbed for Utah and Colorado law issues.  However, this is a starting point.  Let me know if you have any questions.\u000a
p5673
aV\u000a\u000aHey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be myself though.  <NAME/> and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.\u000a
p5674
aV\u000a\u000aBridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with <NAME/> later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier.\u000a
p5675
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is your proposed language with my comments redlined.  Please review.  I would be happy to discuss.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.\u000a

p5677
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,  Have you been able to send email to Bieraugel?  I replied to the email address he sent, but I keep receiving undeliverable messages.\u000a
p5678
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Attached is the amendment for the Mexicana de Cobre confirm.  Please review and if OK forward to Mexicana for execution.\u000a
p5679
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Per our discussion, attached are drafts of <NAME/>'s Master Firm agreements.  Sorry for the delay.  \u000a\u000a  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s preference would be to use these master instead of the GISB agreements for the firm deals.  The Firm GTC were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these Masters in place.  I did review the GISB we currently have in place with Northern States Power (WI and MN).  These agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached Master.  These Masters should address the specific concerns included in your email.\u000a\u000a1.  The Masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the GISB does.\u000a2.  The netting issue we need to address.  The GISB don't have netting provisions, but we don't use GISB for any firm deals over 1 month in term.  I am not sure I understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting.  These Master contain netting provisions.  Let's discuss once you have reviewed the Masters.\u000a3.  Force Majeure provisions are similar to the GTC.  <NAME/> prefers a vary narrow definition of FM.  We modify the GISB FM to reflect this with special provisions.  If you could provide specific comments we can address your issues.\u000a4.  Audit provisions are included in the Masters.\u000a5.  Any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this Master.  If you could provide specific language we can address this issue.\u000a\u000aPutting these Master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient.  Please review and let's discuss and your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at (713) 853-3512.\u000a
p5680
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  I reviewed the form provided.  Some comments	\u000a\u000a1.  Generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper.  From an ENA Upstream overall standpoint, if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered (payment, noms., etc).  \u000a\u000a2.  With respect to this form there are some conceptual issues.\u000a	A.  No specific measures of damages if the parties breach\u000a	B.  No detail on the type of gas being purchase (i.e. Wellhead, Pooling Point, firm, interruptible)  Contract states that "Seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase". We would have to tie this down.\u000a	C.  Nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed.\u000a\u000a3.  There are also some legal issues;  State Law, Arbitration, etc., Indemnity\u000a\u000aIn summary, we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form.  I don't know the dynamics of the relationship.  Are they insistent on using their paper?\u000a
p5681
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Perelingiere had prepared this contract.  Since it was done so recently, it may not have made it into the system yet. Thanks for your help.  I'll check <NAME/>'s files.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI believe what <NAME/> (<NAME/>?) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31, 2001.  I don't think there would be any system changes required.  Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,  Is this correct?  I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can.\u000a\u000aThank you!\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5732
aV\u000a\u000aYou are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  \u000a\u000aOn the San <NAME/> slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads " total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d.\u000a
p5733
aV\u000a\u000aI have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:\u000a\u000aSpecial Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) \u000a\u000aAddition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.\u000a\u000aI think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  <NAME/>, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?\u000a\u000aRecommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.\u000a\u000aFYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by <NAME/> Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.\u000a
p5734
aV\u000a\u000aIn an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. \u000a\u000aOne would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in "constrained" areas on TW.\u000a\u000aSecond would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?\u000a
p5735
aV\u000a\u000aHere's the spreadsheet with numbers for the 3 cases.  Please refer to the Assumptions tab (updated numbers in the Summary, Fuel Price & Rates tabs).\u000a
p5736
aV\u000a\u000aYes, please.  I need the 2002 At-A-Glance, the smaller one with one month per two pages.  Please see my current calendar on my desk if this does not make sense. \u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>!\u000a
p5737
aV\u000a\u000aEffective March 1, 2002, I will not be working the 9/80 schedule anymore.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5738
aV\u000a\u000aHow does this look?  The first slide is the flyer to be distributed to the parents in the kids' bags.  The second slide I'll print to put on a large manila envelope for the each classroom door.\u000a\u000aDid I forget any info?  Does it sound voluntary enough?\u000a\u000aLet me know your comments and I'll run it past someone in the office this evening or on Monday and try to have the envelopes out on Monday.  I'll collect the checks each evening when I pick-up <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5739
aV\u000a\u000aJan,\u000a	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?\u000a
p5740
aV\u000a\u000aMy other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:\u000a\u000aSection 35.2\u000a	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of "incremental revenue".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?\u000a\u000a	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase "guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.\u000a\u000a	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase "the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline".  TK, is the phrase "published indices" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.\u000a
p5741
aV\u000a\u000aThe last slide I'm working on is the "Detail of Market Value" slide.  I have a draft completed, but <NAME/> has not been able to review it.  As long as I can get time with him in the morning and the changes aren't significant I should be able to have the presentation to you.\u000a
p5742
aV\u000a\u000aYou had asked to see a final copy of our presentation.  This is what was sent to Tracy today.  We may have a couple of inserts by Friday.\u000a\u000aPlease call me or <NAME/> if you have any questions.\u000a
p5743
aV\u000a\u000aCan we all plan to get on the phone with <NAME/> tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with <NAME/> about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call <NAME/>?\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a
p5744
aV\u000a\u000aThe source for "Growing Power Generation Markets" pie slide is the Arizona Corporation Commission (this is Arizona's PUC).\u000a
p5745
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> needs to know how much money TW made in 2001 on excess fuel sales (whatever is the most current number - 3rd CE?).  And then he would also like to know revenue in the 2002 Plan dependent on excess fuel sales - let's use the Plan numbers as submitted in Nov.  (FYI <NAME/>, we are re-looking at the 2002 Plan right now & there could be changes.)\u000a
p5746
aV\u000a\u000aI like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to "shippers", we could refer to "customers" instead.\u000a
p5747
aV\u000a\u000aShellley would like to meet at 9:30 on Monday in her office to discuss Transwestern customer accounts.  Please let me know if you have a conflict with this time.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5748
aV\u000a\u000aCould you please put me on your distribution list?  I've found your summaries to be very helpful - I usually get them forwarded to me by someone, but I may not be getting all of them.  Thanks!\u000a
p5749
aV\u000a\u000aDear <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with <NAME/>!\u000a	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, <NAME/> will be a good sleeper.  I told <NAME/> that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe <NAME/>, <NAME/> & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that <NAME/> will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San <NAME/> (<NAME/>'s brother <NAME/>'s boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!\u000a	<NAME/> is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  <NAME/> has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will <NAME/> be?  <NAME/> is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.\u000a	Everything else is good here.  My mom and <NAME/> have started driving here today.  They will get to <NAME/> tomorrow night.  <NAME/> is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.\u000a	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that <NAME/> knows my mom, <NAME/>, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that <NAME/> will have the same.\u000a	Have fun with sweet <NAME/> and take care of <NAME/>.  It sounds like you all are doing great!\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5750
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.\u000a\u000aCould you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.\u000a\u000aLet me know.  Thanks!\u000a
p5751
aV\u000a\u000aCould all y'all check my work =) before I send this out to everyone?  (Scroll-down to the highlighted areas.)\u000a\u000aThank you!\u000a

p5753
aV\u000a\u000aYes, I set it up with <NAME/> & <NAME/>.  We had a good discussion.  I'm going up for the weekly Imbalance meeting today to discuss some things with <NAME/> and <NAME/> (<NAME/> will be there).  Tracy & I are also meeting with <NAME/> & <NAME/> on Thursday to try to "diagram" some of the accounting process with imbalances, linepack & fuel (LOOK OUT!).  When we get the explanation organized, we will be presenting it to all y'all =)\u000a\u000aI hope you had a nice weekend in San <NAME/>.  I know the weather was wonderful.  <NAME/> Hershal is doing better.\u000a\u000aTake Care,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5754
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the projected subscribed capacity and revenue through 2010.  This was updated in February, 2002.  Please review it to determine all of this info is appropriate to be provided to the rating agencies.  Most (if not all) of TW's contracts have confidentiality provisions concerning the rates.  I'm assuming we have Confidentiality Agreements with the rating agencies.\u000a
p5755
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,	\u000a	Did you tell me once that you had documented the calculations contained in the Daily Balance report?  I'm thinking (oh-oh) that I might not be able to talk with you after Friday and I wondered if you could send me a copy of your documentation &/or let me know who will have the file (<NAME/> Hanagriff)?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5756
aV\u000a\u000aI see at the bottom of the Business Plan where Tracy has asked for written assumptions for the forecast from you.  Has this been completed?  <NAME/> would like to see this by sometime tomorrow morning for his review before our 2:00 meeting.  When will we have this?\u000a
p5757
aV\u000a\u000aJan already has TW's average historical rates derived from TW's actuals (contract rates and throughput/MAXDTQ's) totaled up to TW's contract paths for 2000 and 2001.  I am going to use these numbers to allocate the path average rates to the pipeline segments in <NAME/>' template.\u000a
p5758
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a	I prepared the TW Marketing slides.  I have been incorporating <NAME/> and <NAME/>'s comments.  You can work with me on any questions you have or any additional information you may need from Marketing.\u000a	I follow-up on your notes in red.\u000a\u000aThx,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5759
aV\u000a\u000aOooh!  He is soo sweet!  Thanks for the pic's.  We'll have to get our act in gear here with our digital so we can be hi-tech too.  He is darling!!  XOXO to <NAME/> (& you guys too).\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5760
aV\u000a\u000aIn the morning could you please call to Omaha and ask who could print out enough copies of the attached presentation for the attendees of the 9:00 meeting and forward this to them?\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>!\u000a
p5761
aV\u000a\u000aHere's the ROFR spreadsheet.  The last time I updated it was 9/17/01.  I just had <NAME/> run a report out of CBS yesterday so that I could sync-up the ROFR spreadsheet for any long-term contracts, but I haven't had a chance to do it yet.\u000a
p5762
aV\u000a\u000aIt loods good!  Thank you so much.  I'll let you know if we need anything else after <NAME/> looks at the graphs/charts.\u000a
p5763
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the slide detailing expansions to California as of 11/7/2001.  Please review and forward as needed to JPMorgan.\u000a
p5764
aV\u000a\u000aI didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is <NAME/> Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with <NAME/> last Friday that someone in <NAME/>'s group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening?\u000a
p5765
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is a spreadsheet where <NAME/> has calculated the interest owed by SoCal.  The interest totals about $0.5 MM.\u000a\u000aWe have not been billing interest.  The system does not generate an interest invoice until the disputed amount is paid.  Then, based upon when it's paid, the interest is calculated.\u000a
p5766
aV\u000a\u000aSorry!  Here are the bullets: \u000a- 2,500 mile pipeline extending from west Texas to the California border with 1.7 Bcf/day of peak capacity\u000a- Maximum Rate Environment Due to Increased California Demand\u000a- Bi-Directional Flow Capabilities Provides Flexibility to Rapidly Adapt Regional Demand\u000a- Over 90% of Revenues From Demand Charges\u000a- Western Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2005, Eastern Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2002; Well-Positioned for Recontracting\u000a- No New Rate Case Until November 2006\u000a- Overbuilding into Cal. can compromise resubscription of contracts (not unique to TW)\u000a\u000aThe slide includes these bullets, a map of TW and a barchart with 1999-2001 throughput.  I asked <NAME/> to change the 90% to 80% in 4th bullet.  How do you feel about the "Maximum Rate Environment ..." bullet?\u000a
p5767
aV\u000a\u000aI have provided to TW's Gas Logistics Group copies of the following facility related agreements:\u000a\u000a	La Plata Facilities Ownership & Operating Agreement between TWPL & Northwest Pipeline dated November 3, 1995.\u000a	WT-1 Compressor Station Electric Agreements between TWPL & Southwestern Public Service:\u000a		Electric Service Agreement dated March 8, 1996\u000a			Amendment effective June 1, 2000\u000a		Agreement dated October 27, 1999\u000a	Bisti Compressor Station Electric Agreements between TWPL & <NAME/> Compression Services:\u000a		Compression Services Agreement dated March 31, 1999\u000a			Amendment effective June 18, 1999\u000a			Letter Agreement dated June 18, 1999	\u000a			Letter Agreement dated June 30, 1999\u000a		Operations & Maintenance Agreement dated September 9, 1996 (I don't have a copy of this.

Who else would have a copies?\u000a
p5768
aV\u000a\u000aI talked with <NAME/> about this bullet.  Let's insert the phrase "...due to capitalizing on market volatility."\u000a
p5769
aV\u000a\u000aJan, \u000a	What percentage of our revenues from from demand charges in 2001?  <NAME/> has a bullet here that says "over 90%".  Is this in the ballpark?\u000a

p5772
aV\u000a\u000aThat's what I was asking Jan previously - does the 1.8 Bcf/d include any estimates or is that an actual number?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I am waiting for <NAME/> to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide.  He is in Dallas today.\u000a
p5773
aV\u000a\u000aPer our conference call today, here are some ideas to get TW Settlement Value.\u000a\u000a1.	SoCal to commit to TW to let us schedule transport at the SoCal/Topock (South Needles) delivery point.\u000a\u000a2.	SoCal to turnback 20,000 to 25,000/d of receipt capacity from the WTX Pool, at no cost to TW (SoCal continues to pay for it).\u000a\u000a3.	TW has been scheduling PG&E's payback to SoCal at SoCal/Topock to help PG&E and SoCal.  SoCal to schedule this as transport from PG&E/Topock (as a RP) to SoCal/Topock (DP) and pay TW transport fee.\u000a\u000a4.	SoCal to agree (in writing) to dedicate to TW the incremental 50,000/d at Needles becoming available Jan, 2002 until Red <NAME/> Expansion in-service.\u000a\u000a5.	SoCal to amend their OBA to dollar-valued (from volumetric) and cash-out their existing OBA with TW (at TW's index value).\u000a\u000a6.	SoCal to sell storage to TW.\u000a\u000a7.	SoCal to purchase incremental Thoreau to West of Thoreau capacity from TW.\u000a\u000a8.	Extension of SoCal's mainline &/or San <NAME/> lateral contracts.  Or early notice of termination or early notice of ROFR trigger (so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it).\u000a
p5774
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> asked me for a copy of the offer we sent to SoCal on the billing issue.  I must have deleted the e:mail.  Do you still have it electronically & if so, could you forward it to <NAME/>?  He's interested in the excel spreadsheet with the $$ impact.\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5775
aV\u000a\u000aThis is my understanding too.  We can discount GRI away and we only have to pay the Gas Research Institute what we collect.  We have to pay the ACA, if we discount it away.\u000a\u000aOne more check would be <NAME/> Doll.  <NAME/>?\u000a
p5776
aV\u000a\u000aHow does this look?\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aAlso, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:\u000a\u000a	The <NAME/> to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).\u000a\u000a	<NAME/> had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.\u000a\u000a	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.\u000a
p5777
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & <NAME/>,\u000a	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of <NAME/>.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the "washed in stardust" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!\u000a	We had a great visit with "PaPaFlo"!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught <NAME/> to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.

aV\u000a\u000aThe only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, <NAME/> Field Services is not an "owner" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a "hub" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA "wish list" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.\u000a\u000aAfter further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & <NAME/> are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with <NAME/>.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (<NAME/> to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with <NAME/> for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.\u000a\u000aConcerning the rest of our OBA "wish list", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a "settlement" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI don't know if <NAME/> has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with WTX Pool capacity and about that <NAME/> contract you mentioned in our Staff Mtg yesterday, but I looked at my notes and this is what I come up with.\u000a\u000aThe <NAME/> contract that expires 7/31/2002 without ROFR is already taken into consideration as expired in the November, 2002 capacity of 17,300/d we derived last week (which we've already sold 20,000/d to Calpine & PPL).\u000a\u000aOther contracts expiring in 2002 & early 2003 from the WTX Pool are:\u000a\u000a	25841	PG&E	17,200/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)\u000a	26511	PG&E	  8,165/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)\u000a	Total		25,365/d\u000a\u000a	26683	APS	8,000/d		3/31/2003	(subject to ROFR)\u000a		\u000aOtherwise, we have WTX Pool capacity every Apr-Oct of 14,000/d (opposite of SWG's seasonal ctrc).\u000a\u000aThe other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement.  For the month of November, 2002 (for example) we have 22,000/d of capacity we are including in our WT-1 total that is made up of southward paths (20,000/d for USGT & 2,000/d for Astra with receipts north of WT-1 for delivery to WTX delivery points south of WT-2).  This is the most conservative capacity reservation policy.  In the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of WT-1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of WT-1, we would need to compress gas south through WT-1 to make deliveries for these two contracts.  We may want to reassess this.\u000a

p5813
aV\u000a\u000aThe letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:\u000a\u000aOn page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "retailers" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.\u000aAs a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on <NAME/>'s claim of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000asee below.\u000a\u000aFederal price limits backfire\u000aSome generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps\u000a<NAME/> Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer\u000aWednesday, July 4, 2001\u000a?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle \u000aURL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/chronicle/archive/2001/07/04/MN186091.DTL \u000aOfficials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states.\u000aThe warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning.\u000aThe two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages.\u000a"We need some clarity to this order," said <NAME/> Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on.\u000a"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.\u000aThe crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand.\u000aSome companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.\u000a"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said <NAME/> Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park.\u000aAckerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect.\u000a"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."\u000aBLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED\u000aCalifornia authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies.\u000a"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said <NAME/> McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network.\u000aThe Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights.\u000a<NAME/> Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage.\u000a"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences."\u000aSpecifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices.\u000a"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.\u000aThe federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.\u000aAckerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.\u000a"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.\u000a'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'\u000aCalifornia and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output.\u000a"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan)," said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.\u000aUnfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs.\u000aHidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies.\u000a"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."\u000aState officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.\u000aE-mail <NAME/> Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com .\u000a?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle    Page A - 1\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOut-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls\u000aBy Dale Kasler\u000aBee Staff Writer\u000a(Published July 3, 2001)\u000aConfused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.\u000aThe confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Stage 1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect June 21.\u000aOut-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pricing system, said <NAME/> Hidalgo, spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity for the state's financially distressed utilities.\u000a"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusion over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."\u000aThe problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.\u000aMost California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.\u000a"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said <NAME/> O'<NAME/>, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind of certainty at all."\u000aHidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute imports from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.\u000aThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.\u000aFERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was established during the latest alert.\u000aUntil Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour in California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.\u000aBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.\u000aThe ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a credit risk in selling to the state.\u000aO'<NAME/> said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every time the ISO declares a power alert.\u000aIn-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. But out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.\u000a\u000aThe Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com .\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPower Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs\u000aElectricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.\u000a\u000aBy NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer\u000a\u000a     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.\u000a     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply more than 1 million homes, said <NAME/> Hart, deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the state's electricity since January.\u000a     At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.\u000a     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since May 31.\u000a     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.\u000a     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.\u000a     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparently drove away sellers, Hart said.\u000a     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that had committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of the San <NAME/>-based energy conglomerate.\u000a     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it should take effect. They got no answer.\u000a     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.\u000a     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when it is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped lately.\u000a     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summer.\u000a     "Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said.\u000a\u000aCopyright 2001 Los Angeles Times\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our fallen brethren.  Yes <NAME/> Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the bachelor party. \u000a\u000aThe party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of <NAME/>) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and "gourmet" dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.\u000a\u000aThe cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.\u000a\u000a-<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000awhatever babe - i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out - like you.  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these- like when i had chest pains, the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test.  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal.  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable - you should do what you want to do. but i guess what i am saying is that YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DIE !!! so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem....\u000a

I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you have any questions.\u000a\u000a-<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe auction process concludes today and we should no who the winning bid is tomorrow.  It looks like it will be either UBS or Citigroup.  As far as our friends go: <NAME/> Hull got laid off and is looking for a job - he actually got offered to move back to risk but decided not to take the job b/c he thought he had something else in the bag - it turned out that he didn't;  <NAME/> Lenhart - is still here and is in the same boat as I am; <NAME/> Boucher - is still here and is handling the liquidation of EES' retail book - he may or may not continue on with EES depending on whether or not another company is willing to take a chance on EES - apparently there are some pkg deals in the works - he is also interviewing with other companies; <NAME/> got laid off and is touring Europe for a month; Gillette got laid off and moved to <NAME/> to teach English to young <NAME/>ns (how crazy is she?); and <NAME/> still has a job at <NAME/> in tax (the gov't always gets there $$) she is also looking for another job.\u000a \u000aI think that just about covers everything.  I am sure that you have talked to <NAME/> and know his situation.  How is <NAME/> holding up? I never hear anything from him - tell him I said hello.\u000a \u000aBTW, <NAME/> (my bro) get married in February.\u000a \u000aKeep in touch-\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p5992
aV\u000a\u000ano i am just hearing that most everyone got promoted\u000a

p5994
aV\u000a\u000aAre you coming? You are the last one to RSVP.  I need to know so I can make the reservation.\u000a\u000a-<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aYou owe $80 for fantasy football.  When can you pay?\u000a
p6000
aV\u000a\u000aI forgot to mention that if you do not buy the pkg then lift tickets are about $55/person per day.\u000aI think we will probably just book the room and worry about the lift tickets ourselves.\u000a
p6001
aV\u000a\u000aI got your card.  Thanks for joining us on Saturday night.  <NAME/> and I always enjoy your company.\u000a\u000aLove,\u000aE\u000a
p6002
aV\u000a\u000acan't play - maybe we can pick someone up there\u000a
p6003
aV\u000a\u000ai haven't really thought of that yet.  i guess i will wait on the response that i get.\u000a \u000aL,\u000ae\u000a
p6004
aV\u000a\u000athat is good to hear.  i was driving through west u last night and saw quite a few.  i hit a couple of kids so i figure that netted me a few points.\u000a\u000ai look forward to seeing you on saturday\u000a\u000alove,\u000ae\u000a
p6005
aV\u000a\u000awhat's up?  things are pretty hectic here.  you lucked out by getting out of dodge.\u000a\u000a\u000aare you still coming to see the 2001-2002 nat'l champs on T+1?\u000a\u000a-eric\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ahey. long time no hear. how is everything going with you? how is the family doing?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aall i can say is "house of cards"\u000a
p6009
aV\u000a\u000aHow about we all go to dinner at <NAME/>'s on Sunday night?  How does that sound?\u000a \u000a-<NAME/>\u000a
p6010
aV\u000a\u000aWe are going to Lil' Papasito's with some friends on Friday.  Just wanted to know if you wanted to join us.\u000a\u000a-eric\u000a

(lp6014
V\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aI understand that you have approved the request below.  Is this because they are WRA personnel?\u000a \u000aThanks.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6015
aV\u000a\u000aUnbelievable!!  I guess he has sour grapes.  We only paid him not to apply for a job -- unfortunately, insults were not contemplated in our agreement.  Ignore him.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6016
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, would you mind pulling the data for GSP on this.  It is strange that we should be paying unemployment rates for GSP, since it is its own entity, separate and apart from <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aDo you know anything about the other transactions?\u000a
p6017
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> called me last week for some advice.  I had to leave a message for him when I called him back.  So, I gave him your names as backup in case he needs immediate assistance.  \u000a\u000aJust wanted you to know that he might be calling one of you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6018
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWould you please provide me information on which attorney is handling the NEPCO charge?  I would like to obtain information from him and be "in the loop" on all legal matters involving NEPCO's employment practices issues.\u000a\u000aThanks a lot.  I am looking forward to visiting with you in person next week.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6019
aV\u000a\u000aWe need the following data asap:\u000a\u000a1.  Number of total employees at all <NAME/> entities broken down by domestic and US\u000a2.  Breakdown of those domestic employees by whether they are hourly or salaried\u000a3.  Amount of accrued, unpaid vacation balance.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6020
aV\u000a\u000aKriste,\u000a\u000aI believe that all but one of the amendments/bonus memo documents are complete.  The only one in question is for <NAME/> Redmond, whose contract we did not have.  <NAME/> is going to pull the contract in the morning and give it to Twanda.  Twanda will prepare the draft amendment and change to the memo and get it to Kriste for finalizing.  \u000a\u000aThen (I hope) we'll be done!!!!\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS, the number to the grammar hotline is 713-221-8670.\u000a
p6021
aV\u000a\u000aWe need to talk about that meeting with me, <NAME/>, and <NAME/>.  I do not think it went well at all, but I would like to discuss it with you.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6022
aV\u000a\u000aI guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.  Does that matter?\u000a
p6023
aV\u000a\u000aHi, Randy.\u000a\u000aI hope you are doing ok.\u000a\u000aI thought you might be interested to learn that <NAME/> <NAME/> amended her lawsuit to add <NAME/> as a party on Nov. 30.  Of course, the claim will be stayed due to bankruptcy, but it is interesting that she finally did it. \u000a\u000aTake care.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6024
aV\u000a\u000aNo, I know about that one and agree with you that it is critical!  I just wanted to know when we were meeting with Shankman.\u000a
p6025
aV\u000a\u000aFYI, it looks like you are on the way to approval.  Until that time, if you have any excess capacity in terms of time, get with <NAME/> on HR Employee Relations efforts.  Thanks.  MHC\u000a
p6026
aV\u000a\u000aGood morning.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.\u000a\u000aWe will need those segregated as follows:\u000a\u000aEmployees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks.\u000aEmployees involved in Newco/Trading operations.\u000aEEL employees\u000aEmployees remaining in the <NAME/> estate.\u000a\u000aCould you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.\u000a\u000aThanks!!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6027
aV\u000a\u000aTwanda, please print this for me - -I've been having problems when I try to print.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6028
aV\u000a\u000aI think that we should enforce the agreement. Did he get a signing bonus?  If so he probably will have to pay back. He also will have to hnor noncompete. \u000a\u000aWhat happened with <NAME/> Price?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6029
aV\u000a\u000aPlease save as a MHC document -- I think that some of this will be used for powerpoint for Nepco trip next week.  Thanks.  MHC\u000a
p6030
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> do.  I've asked <NAME/> to send you the legal advice we received.\u000a\u000aI've finalized the template today, and should have a draft out tomorrow (Monday).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6031
aV\u000a\u000aI have seen this, but I don't think it should go out.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>/<NAME/>/<NAME/>, please correct me if I'm wrong.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6032
aV\u000a\u000aI know, but that doesn't change the fact that we should articulate the standards that we are using -- I know that they use some criteria that are based on solid business reasons, so let's capture them!  That way, we at least can explain why we did things.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6033
aV\u000a\u000aWe have decided not to make any reps about these plans, since any buyer would not be taking them.  However, we have a data room list that specifies what was made available, and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room.  We remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals, but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate.  Let me know if you have questions.\u000a\u000aWhich deal are you actively working on?  Fire or Wind?  Do I need to be working on the draft agreement?\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6034
aV\u000a\u000aI think we have had our release reviewed by NY counsel already, but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have Drew look at it quickly.\u000a\u000aI agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit.  If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term.  If the situation arises, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6035
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/> <NAME/> has issues with the consulting agreement I drafted for him and wants to use a form that you drafted some time in the past.  Do you want to pick it up?  By copy of this, I am asking Twanda to send you a copy of the agreement we submitted for him.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6036
aV\u000a\u000aI think that the answer is that she will be eligible for the $4500 and will be allowed to continue whatever medical coverage she had elected already until 12/31.  Please refer her to the Q&As on the web site for details.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6037
aV\u000a\u000aWe are working on this issue this week by meeting with Joe Dilg and putting forth a summary memo of the history of the situation, the pay requirements under the contract, and recommendations of how to move forward.  That will be done this week, and everyone on this email will be copied on it.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6038
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe employment lawyer at Littler, Mendelson is named Kerry Notestine.  He is in the loop on this and has copies of the relevant agreements.  I also will have emailed him my summary of the <NAME/> Henderson agreement, so he is up to speed on where we are going from the employment arena.  His number, in case you need an immediate response while I am at NEPCO next week, is 713-652-4748.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6039
aV\u000a\u000aNeither did I.  I just got the comments yesterday.  I'll review the issues on the plane today and provide comments.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6040
aV\u000a\u000aIt is in the Q&As already posted.  We cannot comment on HR policies/plans for Dynegy or for the merged entity because we simply don't know.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6041
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the thoughts.  We are getting through it.\u000a\u000aCameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!\u000a\u000aYour bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get <NAME/> to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD <NAME/> Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  <NAME/> Lunden MC'd.  The <NAME/> Symphony provided music.  Video from <NAME/> W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, <NAME/> Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the <NAME/> Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and <NAME/>, <NAME/> Baker, <NAME/> Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.\u000a\u000aWell, I'd better get back to it.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6042
aV\u000a\u000aFYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of Thanksgiving last year.  He gave me some scoop on the trip.  The weather is nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.  Lots of good food.\u000a\u000aOne thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.  You may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid).\u000a\u000aLater, <NAME/>\u000a
p6043
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, Botchlett is not interested in mediating at this time.  He wants to go for the jugular, I guess.  MHC\u000a
p6044
aV\u000a\u000aFYI -- see what you can find out about this -- perfect opportunity to market OLER's services.  Thanks  MHC\u000a
p6045
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I suggest that we ask <NAME/> <NAME/> to investigate the fact situation here and report back to us jointly.  What do you think?  <NAME/>\u000a
p6046
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI spoke with <NAME/> about the Leaf <NAME/> contracts.  She indicated that we are waiting for details (names, etc) from <NAME/> <NAME/>.  Once we get those, we can generate a draft for review and comment.  I understand that <NAME/> has asked <NAME/> for this data.  Let me know if you have any questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6047
aV\u000a\u000aI've received advice from Vinson & Elkins on this, which I will send your way.  It looks like we can.  MHC\u000a
p6048
aV\u000a\u000aFYI, <NAME/> will handle maintaining the list of all persons who are critical witnesses in future litigation so that we can take that into consideration when managing personnel decisions.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6049
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>. I spoke with GP benefits counsel this morning. There are several business issues outstanding. <NAME/> is trying to get with McMahon to get his take on tham. He is at EB where she is doing a Super Saturday.\u000a
p6050
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. <NAME/> arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.  Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop.  \u000a\u000aWould it be possible for us to arrive late?  I'd hate to create a disturbance, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6051
aV\u000a\u000aRobin,\u000a\u000aDiomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports -- approximately $400K.  I know that <NAME/> was involved in this to great detail.\u000a\u000aOnce the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for regular severance.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> Callahan have been coordinating those issues.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6052
aV\u000a\u000aTwanda, please pull all emails on this subject matter out of my in box and print for the file.  Thanks.  MHC\u000a
p6053
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, we should go ahead and remove these people.  They are employed by WRA, which is in a transition process on a confidential matter.  Please remove them.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6054
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, does this apply to companies in which we have a large ownership interest, but that may not be a "subsidiary"?  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6055
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, it is not <NAME/>'s practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.\u000a\u000aSo, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.\u000a\u000aCall me with any questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6056
aV\u000a\u000aplease send her our standard confidentiality agreement that we attach to the consulting services agreement -- ok to send it by email. thanks\u000a
p6057
aV\u000a\u000aI'd like a copy of that, if possible.\u000a\u000aI think it should state:  Confidential and Proprietary -- Not to be Disclosed to Persons Other Than Human Resources and Legal Department.  If possible, put it on all documents, as well as the cover of the notebook.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6058
aV\u000a\u000aThis looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?  I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type language here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys.\u000a
p6059
aV\u000a\u000aI don't know if you heard, but <NAME/> and I spoke with him, and he is ok with everything.  I guess you can consider this one closed, except that I would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to <NAME/> and me for review and placement in the file.  Thanks!\u000a
p6060
aV\u000a\u000aHello, all.\u000a\u000aAttached is an invitation from Seyfarth Shaw to attend their labor and employment seminar.  It is scheduled for Tuesday, 7/17, and lasts only a half-day.  Generally, their seminars are high quality.  Plus, the cost is only $50. \u000a\u000aLet me know if you plan to attend.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6061
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, please let me know if my email of last night did not go through.  I am in the office now 713-853-6401.  Thanks!!  <NAME/>\u000a
p6062
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aLate last week, I received a call from <NAME/> Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to <NAME/> or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and <NAME/> Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked <NAME/> O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, <NAME/> mentioned that one person in <NAME/> Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give <NAME/> a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.\u000a\u000aLet me know your thoughts on this.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6063
aV\u000a\u000aThe minimum number of days should be 21, and they should have 7 days to revoke it.  Although the ADEA probably would not apply to A&A candidates, it could be an issue for the rest of the organization.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6064
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the resume.  This person's background won't work for us -- we need more transactional work experience for them to be successful here, particularly M&A, major real estate, financing, etc.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6065
aV\u000a\u000aI will provide more detailed comments later, but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all <NAME/> entities domestically.  Similarly, some <NAME/>-owned companies have adopted their own vacation, sick pay, etc.  So, we should be careful about the audience for these communications.  I suggest getting with <NAME/> Johnson on that issue.  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have been getting this question a lot!\u000a\u000aIt has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or something to that effect. \u000a\u000aBecause it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really should follow through.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6067
aV\u000a\u000aI guess I would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like.  Hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6068
aV\u000a\u000aI am happy for us to paper the deal.  I am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for Scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets -- it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6069
aV\u000a\u000aI understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.  Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.\u000a\u000aI agree that it is not a "slam dunk" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.\u000a\u000aOf course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.\u000a\u000aYa'll let me know if you disagree.\u000a
p6070
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAs mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by <NAME/> Lindert against <NAME/> Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 million.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.  \u000a\u000aI have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to <NAME/> Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me). \u000a\u000aThe law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.\u000a\u000aThe case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to federal court.\u000a\u000aLet me know how you want me to proceed.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6071
aV\u000a\u000aHi, all.\u000a\u000aOn the budget for HR Risk Management (formerly OLER), <NAME/> told me to keep things flat for next year.  I would appreciate seeing the numbers for budget projections and actuals for the group year to date, though.  \u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6072
aV\u000a\u000aNo, but we have been meeting on this topic.  We met early this week and are having a follow-up meeting next week.  I will ask <NAME/> Goode to include you by phone, if you want to attend.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6073
aV\u000a\u000aYou need more than the 840 for this -- you also need the IT personnel.  I'll forward those to <NAME/> so she can get started.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6074
aV\u000a\u000aI have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.\u000a\u000aWe also received advice that the Puerto <NAME/> office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.\u000a\u000aIn any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6075
aV\u000a\u000aThat is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If so, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.\u000a\u000aWe could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6076
aV\u000a\u000aYou should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the <NAME/> Corp. Board of Directors.  We do have a plan in place, but we haven't terminated any employees under that plan  in the last few weeks.  So, we can't say that there is not plan in place righ now.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6077
aV\u000a\u000aMisha, I haven't yet received the details about the lunch on the 28th.  I'm out on vacation the end of next week, so I wanted to try to fill it early next week.  Could you forward me the invitation or details?  Thanks.  MHC\u000a
p6078
aV\u000a\u000aI would not want any of our policies to address what is "unlawful,"  as I believe that is a matter for a court. Instead, our policies should state what we want to have in them, and leave the issue of legality to others.  Plus, I wouldn't want any admission of unlawful conduct in our policies.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6079
aV\u000a\u000aToday, I received a demand from <NAME/> Bieser's attorney.  He basically wants a year's pay, plus supervesting of options (which I told him was impossible).  I have given <NAME/> a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand.  Let me know if you want to know the details. \u000a\u000aI suggest that <NAME/> and I get together Monday with a proposed response, which we will run by you before responding to the demand.\u000a\u000aIn any event, <NAME/> will not be returning to the office at all.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6080
aV\u000a\u000aWe will need to look at our vacation pay practice with Weil to determine whether we can pay out in the future for accrued, but unused vacation.\u000aI think we can say that they'll get no less than $4500, but we want to confirm with Weil.\u000a<NAME/>'t know about parking/bus.  I think it is regular course, but we may have to change that regular course.\u000a
p6081
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>. Please feel free to call me on my cell at 713-302-5522 or at home at 713-218-7155 if you need to reach me urgently. <NAME/>\u000a
p6082
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, would you mind getting on the transition of HRRM functions to the staffing and service center groups?  I think that you have the most familiarity with the processes and perhaps could facilitate that taking place next week.  Let's discuss.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6083
aV\u000a\u000aThis will just be Rome and <NAME/>.  Although we believe that most of his claims really are against HMS, his lawyer is claiming that <NAME/> used HMS to defraud Rome.  His lawsuit will be against only <NAME/>.  Therefore, it makes no sense to drag HMS into this at this point (although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed).\u000a
p6084
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAt this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.  <NAME/> <NAME/>, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements.  Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from <NAME/> first.  Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective.  Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement.\u000a
p6085
aV\u000a\u000aHi, <NAME/>!\u000a\u000aI look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.\u000a\u000aI wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in <NAME/>.  Specifically, an employee named <NAME/> <NAME/> claims that he was fired from  his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there.  OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an investigation.\u000a\u000aHave you heard of this?  How would you like to handle it?\u000a\u000aWe can discuss in more detail on Thursday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6086
aV\u000a\u000aOne other thing -- Texas law will apply to those employees in Texas, as state courts will not allow other laws to govern in employee matters.  Oregon is the same.\u000a\u000aAs I re-read, I found more references to vesting or payout dates.  Again, these should be more generic or blank.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6087
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWould you please get access to expertfinder reinstated for my group:  me, Lizzette <NAME/>, Twanda Sweet, and <NAME/> Goode?\u000a\u000aThanks a bunch!!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6088
aV\u000a\u000aI got this request a second time.  Probably <NAME/> would have the best knowledge of exactly how these people were paid.\u000a
p6089
aV\u000a\u000aTwanda/<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI've given the Japanese template to Twanda to revise -- please use the non-VP form and not the form on which I have made the revisions.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6090
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCould you please provide me with PH files and also complete the charts on the following people?  Some of them may have left the company, and others may never have been employed.  <NAME/> you have access to all current/former employees' information?  If not, who would?\u000a\u000aThanks tons!!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6091
aV\u000a\u000aI don't think we should curtail cause terminations.  Others would probably be best to wait unless there is a disruptive situation.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6092
aV\u000a\u000aI can't find it on my blackberry. I can't remember who sent it, and the ones I've reviewed don't have the info.  Why don't you ask <NAME/> Funkhouser for the details?  Sorry about that!  <NAME/>\u000a
p6093
aV\u000a\u000aIt shiuld be cynthia barow instead. I think the benefits info already is in what we sent to katie caplan at weil. Let me know how I can help. <NAME/>\u000a
p6094
aV\u000a\u000aI think that ya'll have handled the legal work for these entities in the past.  Can you provide <NAME/> with this information asap?  Thanks!  <NAME/>\u000a
p6095
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aI guess a separate line of inquiry is whether we owe him payments under his employment contract.  We probably should get with Castleman this week.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6096
aV\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>, for the update.  If they have no interest in putting a settlement offer out there, then I suggest that we schedule the plaintiff's deposition.  Let's turn up the heat.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6097
aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Let us know if these folks are appropriate to include on our "critical for litigation" list.  Thanks!  <NAME/>\u000a
p6098
aV\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I do not think we'll have time for this today, given other critical priorities.  I would suggest that the deadline may be slipping in light of other activities.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6099
aV\u000a\u000aI have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.\u000a\u000aThey want the following asap:\u000a\u000aSigned copies of contracts for <NAME/> Whalley and <NAME/> Kaminsky (who may not have a contract)\u000aSample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily\u000aSigned sample agreement for an IT person, such as <NAME/> Webb (I think I can get this one as well).\u000a\u000aThey also want the following data for the 838:\u000a\u000a	<NAME/>\u000a	Position/title\u000a	2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc)\u000a	Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc.  (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number)\u000a	If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract\u000a	Did the person get a stay bonus last week?  If so, amount.\u000a	Date of hire\u000a	If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.\u000a\u000aThey are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.\u000a\u000aThanks a lot!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6100
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>/<NAME/>--\u000a\u000aI believe that this was not meant for public distribution, but it is a sentiment that I thought you should hear.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6101
aV\u000a\u000aSure, sounds like a good plan to put the flag in Personic to discuss the time limitations.  Other than the specific gas-related folks, I am not aware of a non-solicit of AEP employees.  I'll double check to confirm, though.  MHC\u000a
p6102
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, this is helpful.  Is there any way we can delete the names of persons who no longer are here?  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6103
aV\u000a\u000aDear Grandmother,\u000a\u000aSo sorry we didn't make it  yesterday.  We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart  -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind.  Oops!!!  He had to have a special kind of bandage, but it doesn't hurt him any more, so I think all is going to be ok.  So, I apologize for not making it yesterday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> all is well with you.\u000a
p6104
aV\u000a\u000aI left a voice mail for <NAME/>, indicating that I think we should close out this communication with something to the effect of:  "If you have further questions, please contact ________________."\u000a
p6105
aV\u000a\u000aI believe that these involve issues of intellectual property and thus are more appropriately decided by you.  In principle, I have no issue with <NAME/> indemnifying Accenture for intellectual property litigation relating to content ownership.  On the logo issue, I would have to defer to you and the PR/branding folks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6106
aV\u000a\u000aI have reviewed the contract for <NAME/>.  He has a 3-month non-compete after the termination of his employment.  Is he planning to honor it?  If not, we have to make decisions about pursuing him in court.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6107
aV\u000a\u000aThe consent form should be kept in PH file.   The background check results should be maintained separately.  MHC\u000a
p6108
aV\u000a\u000aI'd like to have access, but I don't have access to "O" drive.  Can that be rectified, or is that beyond your role?\u000a
p6109
aV\u000a\u000aNo, it should remain the top 25 percent, because it is the top percentage of the criteria, not the peer group.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6110
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCan you provide the answers for me?  Then I can decide how to proceed with <NAME/>. \u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6111
aV\u000a\u000aTwanda,\u000a\u000aWe missed <NAME/>'s birthday on Friday -- I can't believe I forgot it!!!\u000a\u000aI'd like to get cake Monday afternoon.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6112
aV\u000a\u000aHere is what we are hearing.  It sounds like it is out of <NAME/>'s hands and is up the INS.  We'll keep you posted.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6113
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I've looked over this list and realized I have no relevant information, so I've forwarded it to <NAME/> and Kriste, who should be able to help you.  Sorry I can't do it myself, but I just don't know anything about the pipes.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6114
aV\u000a\u000aPlease review and let me know what the traders want to do on this -- by Thursday would be good.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6115
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.    For your information, <NAME/>, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.  It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.  Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.\u000a\u000aI'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6116
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, as soon as I receive anything, I'll forward it on.  I am working on it and have been since yesterday.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6117
aV\u000a\u000aI think we should call it a project bonus, not an incentive bonus, because our annual bonus plan is called the Annual Incentive Plan.  Also, we usually use some other language.  I'll ask Twanda to send you our standard retention letter.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6118
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, what do you think of this?  I view it as problemmatic because I believe the grant agreements and the stock plan should govern.  Your comments and suggested revisions would be appreciated.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6119
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have reviewed the NEPCO AGreement to separation pay and release of claims.  I believe that there are significant issues with this because it does not comply with the requirements of the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act.\u000a\u000aI will send you a new waiver form to use.    The one you are using is not valid under the ADEA.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6120
aV\u000a\u000aI got a call from Rome's lawyer, who wants to call the whole thing off because he doesn't think he'll get the money he wants.  I told him we were ready and willing to proceed.  He was going to call the mediator to see if he could cancel without incurring the mediation fees.  So, I'll keep you posted.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6121
aV\u000a\u000aI don't know.  I would suggest that you ask <NAME/> Barrow for starters.  Sorry I am so clueless.  MHC\u000a
p6122
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWhat is the status of our litigation in Puerto <NAME/>?  Has there been a motion to remand?  Is anything scheduled in the next few weeks?  Have we received a scheduling order or a notice of Rule 26 hearing?\u000a\u000aThanks for the update.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a
p6123
aV\u000a\u000aThanks, <NAME/>.  It is only temporary (at least, that's what I keep insisting!).\u000a\u000aI just learned about a new deal involving coal mines in Wyoming or Montana (I can't remember now).  Data room to be opened in <NAME/> on Monday.  I'll send you details asap and let you know if we may need to invite you along.  Would you be available?\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6124
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!\u000a\u000aI believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.   \u000a\u000aInstead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6125
aV\u000a\u000aWhat a delightful and welcome change of pace in my email today!\u000a\u000aDefinitely count us in.  We'd love to join you.\u000a\u000aBy the way, do you have Mata Kroger's new phone number?  Or, is she still with Comsys?\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6126
aV\u000a\u000aFYI -- I've been reviewing most of the Q&As on the questions raised post merger announcement.  I don't think you need to do much, but I wanted you to be aware that this was going on.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6127
aV\u000a\u000aplease send to him our consulting services agreement and also the agreement for contract and other services (<NAME/> has the latest form).  cc to <NAME/> St. Clare.  Thanks!\u000a
p6128
aV\u000a\u000aIt might help if I gave you the names!\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Flores\u000a<NAME/> Hinds\u000a<NAME/> Loehr\u000a<NAME/> Stroud\u000a<NAME/> Tang\u000a<NAME/> Thomason\u000a<NAME/> de la Paz\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a
p6129
aV\u000a\u000aNot a problem if the employee does not date it.  The issue of signature by the company that the agreement is not fully executed until it is signed by company.  MHC\u000a
p6130
aV\u000a\u000aI would say that we should honor the terms of any sale or acquisition agreement with regards to service bridging. If we agreed to do so, then our records should reflect that service date. <NAME/>\u000a
p6131
aV\u000a\u000awho knows.  I can't imagine that a customer would somehow owe insurance to the provider's employees.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6132
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, On the issue of communicating the restated severance plan, below is the recommendation of four different attorneys who have considered the issue.  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYou asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.  \u000a\u000aThe bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:\u000a\u000a	"Provided that <NAME/> meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under <NAME/>'s annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."\u000a\u000aThis language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.  \u000a\u000aGiven the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.\u000a\u000aAs a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.  \u000a\u000aOf course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know if you have any questions.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>. I spoke with lara robinson this morning. She indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made. She also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released. Even if the person never returns due to a conversion to LTD she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees. Seems unusual to me. Would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience. My number is 713-218-7155. Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWhy does this person need Expertfinder?  I didn't get a specific reason from prior emails.  If he needs to locate people, shouldn't Peoplefinder do it for him?  More information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a
p6136
aV\u000a\u000ain general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company, it is considered a voluntary termination/resignation. We haven't made that decision here though. \u000a\u000aAs to solicitation of employees back and forth, it will be a negotiated deal term. I can't recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not. Let me know if you want me to check the latest version \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6137
aV\u000a\u000aGo ahead and pose the question, but the answer should be that we don't comment at all on litigation, and that the terms of severance plan and related waivers will govern the situation.  We should reiterate that we can't provide with legal advice.  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSure, we could set up an LLC entity to employ those people.  They would have issues around payroll and benefits, but those can be handled.  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust a question as to whether Dynegy has been notified that we are amending the contracts of these guys to delete minimum or target bonus and replacing with performance bonus memo?  We may want to send a brief email confirming the discussions and their consent so that we have it for our files.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6147
aV\u000a\u000aI don't think that is true.  Our waiver does contemplate such a release of claims.  I think we should not comment on legal questions and let the terms of our plan and the separation agreements speak for themselves.\u000a

V\u000a\u000aSpoke with <NAME/> Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. <NAME/> could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim. \u000a\u000aLets review presentation, then discuss with <NAME/>/<NAME/> and <NAME/> D.  and proceed to banks. <NAME/> is clearing idea with <NAME/>.

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the information on the GB 58. This boat far exceeds what I want. After the show I concluded that  either a 42 or 46 foot classic is most appropriate for my needs. Would like to also consider the 36 foot model. Thanks for the info though and keep me in mind. I enjoyed talking to you at the boat show and my wife was quite sold on the GB line (after looking at most everything there in detail).\u000a\u000aAs I mentioned I am in no particular rush as I probably have a year before I want to go forward on this but if something exciting came up, either new or used, I may be interested.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - thanks for your note. Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with <NAME/> Lay and <NAME/> McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). \u000a\u000a<NAME/> has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.\u000a\u000aMy final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people. \u000a\u000aI hope this addresses your issue.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>- J Block was just a gas contract. At <NAME/>, risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doesn't fit into a book. <NAME/>\u000a
p6192
aV\u000a\u000aAfter reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:\u000a\u000a1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.\u000a\u000a---or----\u000a\u000a2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from <NAME/> routinely.\u000a\u000aThere are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.\u000a\u000aAny thoughts? <NAME/>\u000a
p6193
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>- talked to Whalley on this. He said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesn't de-motivate people. So I guess we should keep working on it but it most likely won't go anywhere. A big concern <NAME/> has now is that we have $7 billion of int'l assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets. You need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time. <NAME/>\u000a

We have assigned Tracy Ngo, <NAME/> Sacks, <NAME/> Radous and <NAME/> Conwell to power. We also have moved other RAC people into credit, <NAME/> Ruane (VP), <NAME/> Curry (Dir), and <NAME/> North (Mgr). Unfortunately it takes some time to get these people trained on transactional credit issues but they should come along quickly. We are in the market for more.\u000a\u000aIt might be helpful to know if we could clone Tracy, how many would you need, given your plans in the market. Tracy is one of our best people. Also, does being in <NAME/> work or do we need resources in Portland. \u000a\u000aI'll meet w/ Tracy next week when she is in <NAME/> and get her views as well. \u000a\u000aPlease don't hesitate to let me know if we aren't keeping up and of course if you are gearing up for a new market push and anticipate additional needs let us know ASAP because there is a 12 month or so training period required for a strong performer to get up the <NAME/> curve.

aV\u000a\u000aAs mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of <NAME/> as it expands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but others will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional. There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you are in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration.\u000a\u000a-	The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.\u000a-	Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .\u000a-	All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.\u000a-	Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams.\u000a-	Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.\u000a- 	Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions will require more frequent informal meetings.\u000a-	There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit, market risk or our portfolio.\u000a-	All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offer to help out if needed.\u000a-	If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.\u000a-	Encourage weak links in team to perform.\u000a-	Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.\u000a-	If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor.\u000a-	Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC and compensation processes.\u000a\u000aThe existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.\u000a\u000aThis process should begin immediately. \u000a\u000aThanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPlease circ to all of RAC.\u000a\u000a\u000aI want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and <NAME/>'s Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.\u000a\u000aOn another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.\u000a\u000aThings are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6271
aV\u000a\u000aJust between you and I, I think there may be an issue here of a couple personalities. We can't have that in your group or mine. I'll watch carefully.\u000a\u000aOn the subject of timing, we should probably have a standard to shoot for. Time to read contract, run model, review results and communicate. I'll talk to <NAME/> about this.\u000a\u000aOn the issue of the hotline, we do not have everyone trained in running models for EES deals. We are working on getting more people up to speed. Thanks,  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI think you will find much more demand than you think for engineers, although the economy is suffering at the moment. It does not sound like this lady has her act together. I wish I knew more about biomedical engineers. You should talk to the head of the dept. and ask who is big in the industry and send them all letters with a resume attached. <NAME/>'t worry at all about your resume right now, it is almost irrelevant. Your grade point average and salutatorian are relevant. There are very few female engineers in the workplace which will help you a lot. You could work for companies like <NAME/>, Exxon, Shell for example but it would not be in your major. My guess is the major pharmaceutical firms may hire you but you need to research this. The first stop should be the head of the department. Lets talk more on this topic. Love, Dad\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI - I have done the west and I have resaved this file out there.  I highlighted the rows to be changed in yellow.  If we all do this, we should be able to use the same list.  I added a column to the file and put IM S/B, LT S/B and Daily S/B.  \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6398
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.  My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.  I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.  Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add,  said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.  Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.  \u000a\u000aJust a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.  This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.  I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Love\u000aAcct.

p6567
aV\u000a\u000aHere in lies the problem.  These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.  Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.  This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.  For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.  It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.  The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.  Same deals, different issues.  Thanks.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on <NAME/> to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI think the only other solution is to post two curves, one with an SP and one with PR.  You should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type PR and have it look to the SP curve.   Then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value, just two different risk types.  The only other option I see is to change the deals back to the "old" aeco curve that we used prior to this.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6623
aV\u000a\u000aI think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. <NAME/> for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the feedback.  \u000a\u000aYour model now assumes a modification to the Distribution tariff to include a new rate element.  That may get around the Settlement (although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they won't switch).  \u000a\u000aAlso, can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to third-party generators?  Seems like that would require legislative changes.  \u000a\u000aI like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP - one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony - remember if they are earning more from the market than that $ amount, they are overearning on their stranded costs.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a \u000aThanks.  Looks good.  Some thoughts for you to consider:\u000a \u000a1.    Not sure that Impact #1 makes sense to present.  No real reason to set CTC = 0 c/kwh on Jan 5 (CalPX was still in operation).  I think that Impact #2 better captures the idea.  Also, probably not good to use the term "CTC Eliminated".  Maybe should say "CTC = 0 c/kwh".  Given the CPUC's March 27 Order, the Utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until March 31, 2002.\u000a \u000a2.     In calculating Impact #2, what did you use as the Jan 19 - Aug baseline?  Did you calculate the hit of ($104.5) from actual bills or based on our DJ Index model (there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline)?  Also, I assume that the Feb - Aug timeframe was relatively low because EES and EEMC had most of their load on bundled service.\u000a \u000a3.    Probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for PX Credit calculation and most specifically the PG&E Adjustment.  Also, may be interesting to have the $ impact of the PG&E Adjustment (the rate adjustment to re-capture their previous mistake).  I think that this is something we need to go into the CPUC to fight pretty quickly.\u000a \u000a4.    Should Impact #4 and Impact #5 apply to SCE's loads?  In column 4 it looks like it does.  SCE is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge.\u000a \u000a5.    Probably better to model Impact #5 as of Oct 1 not Sept 1.\u000a \u000a6.    Can you break out the volumes for "vintage" contracts versus "retail gen with passthru" contracts?  You haven't shown anything for (a) Utility Undercollection costs or (b) CDWR bond fees.  These costs may hit our vintage contracts.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI agree with your arguments.  The other problem with SCE's analysis is that they had a DEFINED stranded cost amount and they deserve that money. \u000a\u000aWhat California did (my explaination) is that SCE was offered frozen rates for 4 years.  All of the margin they "earned" was shareholder's compensation for moving to direct access.  If the total $$ of margin was $0 or less, this implies simply that SCE had no generation stranded costs. \u000a\u000aThe entire argument that SCE is making forgets the $Billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a \u000aMy thoughts on the filing.\u000a \u000a1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.\u000a2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?\u000a3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  \u000a \u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6756
aV\u000a\u000aHere are my thoughts --\u000a\u000a1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.\u000a2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.\u000a3.	<NAME/>, call <NAME/> N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).\u000a4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption.\u000a5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.\u000a6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask <NAME/> Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.\u000a7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.\u000a\u000aI didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI received a call from <NAME/> Brown who said that he had visited the NYPSC and NYISO to discuss load curtailment.  He had placed a few calls into you and hadn't heard back.\u000a\u000aWhen you get back, please let me know where this stands.  No big deal, but I want to understand what is going on with the load curtailment efforts.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6759
aV\u000a\u000aPlease add so we can get to <NAME/> on Monday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6760
aV\u000a\u000aI'd let <NAME/> make the call.  As long as we understand the issues well, maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6761
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aWhat does this do to our current book of customers on MSG?  <NAME/> our $$ margin evaporate?  Is there some other "solution" on how to restructure the FE retail market?  What wholesale issues does FE need to change to help the EWS desk?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6762
aV\u000a\u000aWell.  <NAME/>'t they got themselves in a pickle?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6765
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  Let me know how the desk sees it.  Also, please make sure that we talk with EES gas (<NAME/> Black).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6766
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for keeping <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> informed.  I give this chance a very low probability right now, but we'll see.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6767
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the update.  It is disappointing that AGA is not opening the process, although the final EISB Retail Gas standards will need to be vetted by an ANSI group so we'll get our comments in one way or the other.\u000a\u000aAlso, what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocols across the board?  Seems like pushing NARUC to agree that this is the right vehicle makes sense. \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6768
aV\u000a\u000aI'd say we want tariff language before any investigation.  I don't typically like investigations.  I like complaints.  My thought is to pre-sell tariff changes to FERC with a broad coalition and then get the Ohio PUC to ask FERC the question.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6769
aV\u000a\u000aInteresting.  Seems to me that EPSA needs to help AZ do better by its citizens - it's not just APS that's a "bunch of neanderthals" (to use a <NAME/> Shapiro phrase). \u000a\u000aI don't understand something else - Is Mumaw APS' and EES' counsel in AZ??  How is this possible?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6771
aV\u000a\u000aSorry that I am just getting back to this.  I think that one of the key roles for Reg Risk Analytics is to "validate" the appropriateness of regulatory assumptions in EWS retail tariff curves as well as help Govt Affairs build risk management plans.  \u000a\u000aLet's talk soon.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6772
aV\u000a\u000aLet's talk early next week.\u000a
p6773
aV\u000a\u000aOn coalitions, I was thinking about other market participants.  Agreed that Cinergy could be the vehicle.  Also, maybe make an informal presentation to FERC before any filing, etc.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6779
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aIf the ONE RTO doesn't have a day-ahead market, what happens?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6780
aV\u000a\u000aA couple of points --\u000a\u000a1.	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to "determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC".  Is this correct?  Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?\u000a\u000a2.	Throughout the document the idea of "T&D charges" is used.  I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?  We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.\u000a\u000a3.	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.  The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6781

aV\u000a\u000aPSE&G called yesterday to ask for an LC or cash collateral of $1.0 MM to displace our Corporate Guarantee of $1.3 MM.  They are sending more information in a letter to <NAME/> <NAME/> copied to me.  THere is a 5 day turnaround - early next week this will be due.\u000a
p6784
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to take something to <NAME/> Leff by end of business tomorrow.  Whatever we have.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFine.  People are shocked.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6786
aV\u000a\u000aAmr --\u000a\u000a<NAME/> things are well.  I saw a notice for a meeting on Caribbean Energy Jan 31, 2002 in Miami by CBI.  The information is at www.cbiglobalenergy.com.  Thought maybe you'd want to go and flash yourself around.\u000a\u000aTake care,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6787
aV\u000a\u000aOk.  But if this case ends up in Settlement, we should have our priorities outlined before the case.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6788
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aMy only question is one of emphasis.  Are points 3&4 the key for <NAME/> T.?  If so, should we move them up higher?  Also, why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points?  The length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate.  Maybe a list of bullet points up front?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6789
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the info.  Not sure what we're doing.  I'll pass this along.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6792
aV\u000a\u000aThanks Luiz.  As a follow-up, I'd like to be on record as saying that the PUCT wasted my time in flying to <NAME/> (when plane travel is not secure, I'd add) and not even listening to my statements.  Why bring us if they had already made the decision?  Also, I don't know who is going to pay for more Market Readiness work in SPP unless AEP agrees to pay our costs.  The customers pay for their activities.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6794
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & <NAME/> --\u000a\u000aWe need to be coordinating on this.  You both met with these people at different times.  I don't want to be creating work or stepping on each other.  I don't think there is any problem, but let's sit down and coordinate.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6797
aV\u000a\u000aThe PPO - Power Purchase Option - is a unique program based on the IL restructuring law.  Texas has no analogous service.  \u000a\u000aI agree with your statement that we don't need an RTO, we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules.  It's important to keep consistent messages.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6798
aV\u000a\u000aErin --\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is working right now to try and develop its policy on this issue.  Clearly, our primary goal is to ensure that market makers such as <NAME/> are treated fairly by the FERC rules vis-a-vis other market participants.  While we are not yet enamored with any policy option, we are committed to helping FERC do whatever is necessary to create a strong and well functioning marketplace.\u000a\u000aAs soon as I have any more, I'll let you know.  <NAME/> Novosel and I are intending to come to the meeting.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6799
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aThe only way to collect the "overpayment" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6800
aV\u000a\u000aDoes EPSA agree that FERC should require all Transmission Providers should agree to an RTO of the FERC's choosing or lose MBR for all affiliates?  That's the other message <NAME/> should put out.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p6806
aV\u000a\u000aNot until all of the key electricity fixes are included in the package - remember RTOs are still voluntary, the Courts have yet to require FERC to do away with the Native Load exception, and NERC is in charge of reliability.  This is clearly the biggest issue for the Publics.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6807
aV\u000a\u000aSo the short answer is that EES needs to change its procedures?  Also, is the 50kw right for all markets?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6808
aV\u000a\u000aIn what forum will this be discussed?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6809
aV\u000a\u000aNot sure how this got through the "process".  Please feel free to call on me if this isn't getting fixed right.  Also, should we just have PGE pull the application and re-file with different terms.\u000a\u000aAlso, <NAME/> you should let Amr know and keep track - he can try and quantify.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6810
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI see that you are on the panel on market monitoring.  <NAME/> Perrino and <NAME/> Comnes are following the issue for <NAME/> in the Western power markets as RTOs are formed.  It may make sense for some people from Govt Affairs to talk with you to discuss current issues and focus of FERC and others?  If we can get together, please let me know a good time.\u000a\u000aAlso, the attached paper from EPSA on Market Monitoring is something we support through our trade association.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

People at FERC thought we had bought into the "new NERC" <NAME/> DOES NOT SUPPORT NERC in working through commercial issues.  We need to develop our opinions of where to go next, but right now you can respond to <NAME/> Nevius that we still don't believe that NERC and its process/organziation is the right vehicle.  We are willing to find a way to do this, but we can't have the same SRO bullshit that they have been saying for 3 years.\u000a\u000aSorry I missed the call.  I'll talk with you guys Friday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p6813
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & <NAME/> --\u000a\u000aDo we have to do something related to this?  Thanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000aNote also that in a separate development FERC\u000asimultaneously opened a broad investigation under Section\u000a206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new\u000amarket-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide.\u000aWhat this means is that, although only three utilities are\u000amentioned in this initial order, it is expected that FERC\u000awill continue to take steps to constrain what it believes\u000ato be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30\u000acompanies are awaiting similar reviews by FERC to\u000adetermine if the commission believes they exert market\u000apower. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires\u000apower providers with market-based sales authority to amend\u000atheir tariffs within 60 days to provide FERC with\u000aopen-ended authority to order refunds if the commission\u000adetermines that market manipulation has occurred.\u000a

p6821
aV\u000a\u000aYes this gets at my issues.  I want to build your matrix and <NAME/>'s together.  No where do we deal with reporting yet?  Also, we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming "point people".\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aGoing forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.  I have asked <NAME/> Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with <NAME/>, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).\u000a\u000aI fully concur with <NAME/> that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that <NAME/> be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.\u000a\u000aIn addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with <NAME/> to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.\u000a\u000aI will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS - I'll ask <NAME/> to give you an update on the IL bonding status.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aFine work. Looks like we are moving forward in the SE.  \u000a\u000aA couple of discussion points.    I am still not so much in love the LMP as this paper makes it seem you are (I don't believe there is a perfect solution).  Also, the document is not consistent relating to Control Area consolidation.  For instance, the issue around CA or RTO with tagging makes no sense if there is only one CA - the RTO.  This is important to highlight to the ALJ.  The easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world.  Also, I still don't fully understand why we are happy that the SAC gets to pick the IMA.  I personally despise the concept of a SAC - never has worked when times get tough.  Also, no real discussion (or maybe I missed) of timing to implement - next phase?\u000a\u000aAnyway, great work in the mediation.  Keep pushing these guys from the South.  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThere was a discussion today involving Home Depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a DASR.\u000a\u000aTo make sure that we are all on the same page (please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following) --\u000a\u000a1.	We (meaning EES broadly) do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 MW (otherwise known as non-Price to Beat).\u000a\u000a2.	For non-Price to Beat customers that have not been DASRd or have no contract, the Affiliated REP will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after Jan 1, 2002 under a blanket Term of Service Agreement (let me know if you want copies) under the following price terms \u000aTXU Energy Services cost = $5 per kw for Demand (based on highest demand in last 12 months) + $50/Mwh + $100/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.  \u000aReliant Energy Services cost = [1.5 * Daily Gas Index * kwh] + [{1.15 * Capacity Price} * kw (billing demand)] + $490/month + Delivery Costs + Taxes.\u000a\u000a3.	If the customer does not pay their bill, they will then be placed on POLR service.\u000a\u000a4.	The AREP offers month-to-month service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation.\u000a\u000a5.	Next opportunity to DASR these customers will be Dec 16, 2001.\u000a\u000a6.	When we find a buyer for the Texas book or all of the company, EES intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the non-Price to Beat customers.  This implies that we will not be sending out the Opt-Out provision to non-Price to Beat customers.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  The key, of course, is to create a filing that could not be used against us at FERC on these issues.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aBefore we do anything on this issue, I would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues (primarily the proper reformation of the PX Credit calculation after Jan 18 and the application of the 1c/kwh surcharge).\u000a\u000aOn this issue, assuming that we haven't discuss the failure of SCE to apply our account's past credit with the CPUC (given that the bills were just received), I can't imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, we have not identified where the "credits" are if they are not on the customer's accounts.  \u000a\u000aMy recommendation is to first (a) work with SCE - have <NAME/> Dasovich run the traps and (b) discuss the issue with CPUC Division of Energy and see if there is a solution without Complaint. \u000a\u000aIf this doesn't get us anywhere before August 19, then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the CPUC.  I am not opposed to LeBouef looking into federal action, but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies.\u000a\u000aPlease call me.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aP.S.

I will try and set up some time the first week of December.\u000a4.	I have put <NAME/> Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).

If you have any questions, please call me.\u000a\u000aAlso, <NAME/> will sign on to a petition to for extension of time in the NG/ARTO case (not sure when this is due out).  Some other people were pushing it and with everything going on here at <NAME/> we needed more time to respond.  Please don't take this as a signal that we can't continue to discuss and maybe help find a solution.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a=============================\u000a\u000a1) Profit-RTO - Where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state ? Stage III? Stage IV?\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a2) Regarding document "Response of National Grid USA to questions posed by the Commission": Does it imply that core, for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process? Wasn't the NETA design subject to an extensive \u000aconsultation, even for profit, NG core functions?\u000a\u000a3) If each Transco manages it own OASIS, how can we avoid fragmentation (balkanization), pancaking and many other\u000anegative aspects and seams that the RTO process is trying to eliminate? How can you achieve one-stop shopping? By outsourcing those functions to one single third party?\u000a\u000a4) As a follow up question, what are the mechanisms to assure that this "potential" fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in T, particularly in important inter-tie investments?\u000a\u000a5) What kind of PBR mechanism are you envisioning for the Transco-RTO? Are you thinking about including "external" measures such as cost to provide ancillary services, congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing?\u000a\u000a6) Are you envisioning an RTO-Transco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested? Or can the model live with a "light" RTO where part of the assets are divested but others are not (and sign an operating agreement with the RTO. Would your proposed Matrix of RTO Functions (page 9) still be robust under this scenario?\u000a\u000a7) Can your proposed RTO model dovetail with an LMP/Congestion Management system based on financial rights? [Our understanding is that NETA completely reorganized the UK pool. The UK system now looks like a "self-dispatch" physical rights model] \u000a\u000a8) As a follow up of the previous question: Assuming Alliance adopts a self-dispatch, physical rights approach similar to the one NG operates in the UK today. <NAME/>'t you think that this will create significant barriers/seams with other neighboring RTOs, considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch, LMP and financial rights for most RTOs in the US?\u000a\u000a9) If your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch, LMP/financial rights, shouldn't some functions in your "Martix of RTO Functions" be collapsed? For example: management of congestion prices, calculation of congestion, operations of energy markets and generation redispatch?\u000a\u000a10) Procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as non-core. However, in the UK system, this represents a significant role of the Transco, with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement. Is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the RTO and consequently will be part of the PBR formula?\u000a\u000a11) Generation interconnection. Obviously, your proposal did not go that far. Conceptually, do you favor a system whereby T fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the UK model whereby fixed costs (use of the system) are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component (and connection costs are treates separately, according to a shallow method?\u000a\u000a12) Establishment of transmission rates. How to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the Transco itself will establish its T rates? Are you thinking about some possible non-regulated activities?\u000a\u000a13) You stated that separation and control of T assets persists, to a large extent, in the Collaborative Model proposed as part of the Southeast Mediation. Do you think that the Independent System Administration model is superior in this regard? What are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models\u000a

We also have collateral in each ISO (NE-ISO, NYISO, PJM, CAISO).  \u000a\u000aIt will take some time to de-DASR to Dual Billing and until our accounts switch, the Utilities will hold the Collateral.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aLet's talk.  \u000a\u000aWe are arguing against NERC, but <NAME/> needs to understand that something must be in its place. We have a policy that we are supporting - giving reliability to FERC - and that is <NAME/>'s approach.  Have you communicated that to <NAME/>?  \u000a\u000aAlso, on RPS and energy source reporting, I agree but this may be a part of the final package.  Also, the language I read allows the FTC to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGreat news.  Are there any other MD Commissioners that Ms. McDonald thinks we should visit with?  \u000a\u000aOn the idea of NYISO vs. PJM, I was reading in Restructuring Today yesterday about some elements that NY thought was better than PJM.  I think that we need to "find" three things to give to the NYISO in the development of a single market...allocation of FTRs comes to mind.  I agree that PJM and its staff are the key elements, but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that NYISO does something well??\u000a\u000aShould we do another round of New England meetings to push our support - with McGreevey winning in NJ, will the NJBPU change its focus?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aDo we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?  I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.  Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7010
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000aIt makes sense for <NAME/> and <NAME/> to get together (I am available to talk tomorrow and have asked <NAME/> to set something up).  \u000a\u000aAlso, we need to work together to make sure that EES' reports, taxes, and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion (with the right internal groups).\u000a\u000aOn the IL Bond issue, there must be a disconnect between us and the ICC.  The ICC believes that our Bond isn't current.  Maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow?\u000a\u000aCall if anyone has any questions.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aIt seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?\u000a\u000aLet's sit down on Thursday am and talk.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7018
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aWhere does this stand?  I just read the text and agree with <NAME/>.  Most importantly, the HHI may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of ComEd service.  \u000a\u000aAs important, I don't think the ICC cares too much about <NAME/> losing market share.

p7031
aV\u000a\u000aJamie --\u000a\u000aThanks for the external view on legislation.  I agree that most of the bills don't "get it right" - the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance (which of course would be wrong).  Not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work - not enough $$ to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7032
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aPls ask <NAME/> <NAME/> where these stand.  I thought that the FERC didn't approve.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7033
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI will be traveling back from CA tomorrow so I can't make the call.  Some things to be aware of --\u000a\u000a1.	EES/EEMC v. SCE Complaint\u000a\u000aWe filed Aug 30 before the CPUC asking the CPUC to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  <NAME/> Dasovich will call <NAME/> Fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  If complaint moves forward, SCE will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  <NAME/> is preparing similar filing for PG&E, although we need to seek Relief from the Stay.  \u000a\u000a2.	California Legislation\u000a\u000aSCE MOU bill (that includes DA issues) moved Aug 29 through Assembly Energy Committee.  Needs to go to Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  Hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  By removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal Democrats.  Governor <NAME/> is asking Business to find 15+ Republicans to move the bill.  Trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to Sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that SCE will pay our Negative CTC if $$ exists.\u000a\u000aAlso, the Windfall Profits bill has moved through Assembly Committee.  It has to go through Assembly Appropriation and full Assembly.  <NAME/> Thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a3.	AG Subpeona / Sen Dunn Subpeona\u000a\u000aLitigation about both Subpeonas was heard this week in SF and Sacramento.  <NAME/> Kirby believes that he may have swayed the Court in the Sen Dunn to provide a protective order.  A final decision may be issued next week.\u000a\u000a4.	FERC Refund Case\u000a\u000a<NAME/> presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.  Range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see <NAME/> <NAME/> for exact $$).  I have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by <NAME/> Comnes.  Oral testimony is being prepared in PNW case for next week.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a5.	NE RTO Mediation / SE RTO Mediation\u000a\u000aBoth proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the ALJ issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  Looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single NE RTO energy market is Nov 03 (PJM thinks it can happen by May 03 but wants some cushion).  <NAME/> Novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  Also, ICAP and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  <NAME/> Nicolay believes that the ALJ will recommend moving toward a PJM model.\u000a\u000a6.	CPUC Decision to Suspend DA Retroactive\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> continues to push the CPUC to remove the retroactive date in the current Proposed Decision.  Some rumors that the CPUC will again delay a decision until Sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).\u000a
p7034
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> -- Is this for both EES and EEMC?  Is EPMI in this bill?  Can we pay separately by company?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is another file.\u000a
p7038
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aFERC has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of "security" upgrades assuming they are reasonable.  I know that the Bush Admin will now have the response as its top priority.  I think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform.  FERC postponed announcing its Work Plan this week but my guess is that Chairman Wood will continue down his course.  \u000a\u000aRetail competition in different states was already under fire from the California situation.  Not sure if this week's events will have any major changes.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a
p7039
aV\u000a\u000aOn point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.\u000a\u000aOn point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7042
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & <NAME/> --\u000a\u000aThanks for the update.  I am concerned that "customers" are talking about having NERC deal with commercial matters without first agreeing to FERC's control over everything? \u000a\u000aWe should discuss the Goulding Report when you return.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7043
aV\u000a\u000aA few thoughts before the NG meeting --\u000a\u000a1.	Maybe we should (as a team) call Transelect (<NAME/> Buckman) before our NG meeting.  You may remember that Transelect sent an initial letter into Skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the NG application to be managing member of the ARTO.  I think that it would be good to call Buckman and ask if he has a better idea than NG.  We are right now stuck between two very bad answers - let AEP and FE construct a managing member or have NG.  Maybe Transelect has a better solution.\u000a\u000a2.	Chief Issues with NG --\u000aa.	are they "really" independent?  having a short position in NY and owning generation in NE effectively makes NG into a "market participant" - I think that <NAME/> should make as a hold firm position that to operate an RTO there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence.\u000ab.	who do they feel the customer is?  maybe we want to get <NAME/> <NAME/>'s take on their business model from the UK.  it is critical that the new RTO operators across the country view traders/marketers and generators as their key customers.  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want - pass thru, PBR, etc.? \u000ac.	who writes the tariff?  I would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the RTO work to date has been that FERC has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little (if any) control over future changes.  the RTO operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints - (1) must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and (2) must not damage the assets.  \u000ad.	do they intend to build/own transmission and how does this impact the energy markets?  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that EPMI may take in the energy market.  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business?\u000ae.	how do they intend to provide balancing energy?  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances.  what is NG intending to do on this issue?  does NG believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single RTO?  does NG support unbalanced/uncovered schedules day-ahead?  \u000a\u000aAlso, just to let people know, Kerry Stroup will also be working on the Midwest RTO efforts going forward.  Please keep him included on the e-mails.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7044
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI hope that I didn't come across too strongly just now.

p7046
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that "passes thru" congestion.

We knew that the CPUC was at a minimum going to investigate how and/or whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge $$ to DA load given their earlier statements.  The issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and (I believe) as leverage for other issues.\u000a\u000a3.	We are coordinating with the big customers who recently left.  They are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity.  This is as much their fight as it is ours.\u000a\u000a4.

aV\u000a\u000aI still think that <NAME/> should be advocating some form of Negawatt program for non-retail access states.  Using an RTP tariff that more closely tracks the wholesale prices from an RTO balancing energy market with locational signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load response needed to keep prices from skyrocketing - of course this would require a DA market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage.\u000a\u000aBy the way, I disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity.

In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  \u000a\u000aAlso, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.

Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these\u000aproceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be\u000aaddressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method\u000ato determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there\u000aare no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar\u000aprovision in its tariff.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI was speaking yesterday with <NAME/> <NAME/>.  He indicated that we continue to have (or may have soon) litigation surrounding our ownership interest in Cornhusker.  \u000a\u000aThis is important primarily because the Texas Public Utility Code requires that the PUC approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1% - which Dynegy and <NAME/> will have.  \u000a\u000aI want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the PUC appropriately given the current dispute.  If you have any specifics, please let me know or give me a call.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7169

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  <NAME/> you may want to be on this call.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7171
aV\u000a\u000aAgree.  Would be good to have the utilities' answer in graphic form (17+ RTOs) versus FERC's model on a side-by-side.  Discussion of the TCA work on natural markets to support FERC.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs you can see from the comments below, staff at the Texas PUC is considering whether or not certain areas of Texas are ready for competition (the non-ERCOT region).  \u000a\u000aWho on your teams do we need to talk to understand the implications of this action?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7185
aV\u000a\u000aIn our discussion of the <NAME/> model, we don't outline when the cap would be set?  Would the <NAME/> model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we don't exceed.  Maybe make this point stronger.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7186
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & Thane --\u000a\u000aCan we have a meeting this week (maybe Thursday at 3:30) to discuss this?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7188
aV\u000a\u000aI agree with <NAME/> Shelk to not attack the CBO report.\u000a\u000aWhile the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators "may" have withheld power, the basic argument is that "DEREGULATION ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED."   In addition, the paper states that "MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHES TO THE STATE'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICITY DEREGULATION."\u000a\u000aIn addition, California's response of "DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS."\u000a\u000aI hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the State's poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis.  The CBO finds that "WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET"..because "FEATURES OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET."\u000a\u000aSeems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (together with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly undercuts the "political" arguments of the <NAME/> administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible long-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consumers.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7189
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t we want the ISO to provide to whom the refunds are entitled?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLet me know about how you intend to move forward.  Probably the same team as the CA reporting.\u000a\u000aAlso, what did AGA do with its Storage Figure Report?  I heard that they cancelled the publication.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7191
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aThe PUCT called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information.  Have they communicated with you about this?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aSome interesting language for the ICAP team.  Please forward along.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is especially problematic given that EES and ENA can not comply with the reqts as defined.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7194
aV\u000a\u000aYes, but I think we may lose that rating.  What is the impact if that were to occur?  Seems like we should (a) identify our situation given today's environment and (b) identify the impact of one further downgrade.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7195
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI'm guessing that <NAME/> and/or <NAME/> have responded.  The short answer is that there are going to be a number of legal tests before we are "completely" in the clear.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7196
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI thought that <NAME/> set up a daily call regarding the CA and Pacific Northwest Refund litigation at FERC?  It's not on my calendar.  Can you please call <NAME/> Hawkins to verify and put on my calendar?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI will get with <NAME/> and his team and pull this together.  Of course, much of the activity with Utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements (which change over time).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7202
aV\u000a\u000aSee last bill.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7203
aV\u000a\u000aLooks good.  Why doesn't EPSA propose a timeline for the FERC to order?  This could be a signal that we only want one "rule change" date.  Also, maybe we can build in <NAME/>'s argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7204
aV\u000a\u000aMy only addition would be to strengthen the answer to #5 - RTOs, even if formed, do not explicity resolve the question of the Native Load Exception.  I think that this is critical to highlight if this issued is raised.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI read the same.  It was crazy.  Their solution is to tell us to do what we said didn't make sense.  We won't give the FERC made up information.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aNo.  Although the lack of a concrete decision is a "decision" - just not one we like.  Our goal is to get this dealt with by end of November.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMy fault for not making it clear that you should have been in the loop.  We will send out a message across the board to help with this.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Florida Wholesale (EWG w/o CCN)\u000a2.	AZ opposition to the APS - Pinnacle West generation "sale"\u000a3.	Continue pushing at state level for NOx fairness in allocation to IPPs\u000a4.	Re-instate Direct Access in California.\u000a\u000aMany EPSA members (led by <NAME/>) will fight against direct access.  I won't push hard here.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a[Steffes, <NAME/> D.]\u000a
p7242
aV\u000a\u000aHere are my thoughts / issues with the EPSA paper:\u000a\u000a1.	The EPSA paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that FERC Staff proposed.  Should EPSA at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed?  Gives EPSA an "out" of this recommendation if it proves later that FERC's application of the Delivered Price Test is unworkable.\u000a\u000a2.	 I don't understand when EPSA says "Our recommendation, therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power" on page 2 of the draft?  Why should EPSA indicate that it is comfortable with a 20% Economic Capacity test to FERC.  I would argue that 35% is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position.  Also, is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in "real-time"?  Having a once and done for three year application is ok, but if we are conditioned that we can't get beyond 20% in any market, what does this do to trading and how would this be reported?\u000a\u000a3.	  The discussion on Available Economic Capacity and its implication for having a "bias against new entry" is confusing.  Maybe we should clairfy our concerns.  \u000a\u000a4.	The argument that ALL new generation is by definition pro-competitive needs to be strengthened.  It should be explained in the context of the Delivered Price Test.  Also, it that still true if a party which holds 100 MW in a 500 MW market builds a 100 MW power plant - now 200 MW in a 500 MW market?  Maybe I am missing something.\u000a\u000a5.	EPSA needs to make the argument that Conditioning MBR on vague rules is wrong and anti-competitive earlier in the paper.  This is my biggest concern - that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market "breaks" even though our fundamental presence has not changed.\u000a\u000a6.	I don't understand the EPSA paper on RTO versus non-RTO markets.  EPSA endorses something but I'm not sure what?  What does this mean if I sell on TVA's network?  I appreciate blanket authority, but I wonder about exactly how this would be constructed?  Would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority?  Also, doesn't this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who don't want competition - if they never set up an RTO they never face competition?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Also, my understanding was that the CPUC simply disallowed the CDWR from having straight passthru without review.

p7259
aV\u000a\u000aAlso, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

He is interested in any analysis that we may have provided related to the <NAME/> Properties deal with the Master Meter issue.  \u000a\u000aIf anyone has any old files on this, please send his way.  Also, any updates on where we stand (e.g., Ohio court cases) would be good.  \u000a\u000aWe probably need to have a review of our rights and obligations so that we can properly book the deal.  After we get Joe our info, we can regroup to determine next steps.\u000a\u000aThanks.  If anyone has any questions, please call.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7267
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/>, & <NAME/> --\u000a\u000aCan we sit down and discuss our strategies going forward in light of this RD?  I'd like to understand where there are opportunities (both for POLR outsourcing and standard market entry).  I don't think that there will ever be a huge surplus in generation (and there shouldn't be in a competitive market).  Instead of focusing on something the NYPSC can't control, why not work on demand responsiveness?  Better metering technology would certainly help.\u000a\u000aLet me know when a good time would be?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7270
aV\u000a\u000aSeems to me that we need to engage in AZ (along with NV and OR?) in the Western states to try and push competition forward.  Why don't we first assemble a (1) what we know - what we don't know memo and then (2) look at oppotunities to push our agenda.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> - everyone is looking to you to lead us to the promised land in AZ...  GO GET 'EM!!!!!!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Total megawatts of your company's equity ownership as of June 1, 2001 in competitive generation assets operating and under construction in the United States (including PURPA plants) - (probably good to start with <NAME/> Coldwell).\u000a\u000a2.	Total megawatthours of market-priced wholesale and retail sales for the 12 months ending March 31, 2001 (probably just get <NAME/> <NAME/> to sum up our monthly sales (I would have a separate total for wholesale financials) and use someone from <NAME/> Hughes shop for physical retail sales).\u000a\u000aCall me to discuss.  We need to get this in by August 18.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is the file.  While there are some quotes, remember that the analytics were never taken to the final decimal.  We were mainly trying to make a political point.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7280
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, etal  --\u000a\u000aAttached is the complaint that EES intends to file tomorrow against SCE related to the recoupment of our Negative CTC.  As you aware, after returning our customers to DA recently, our billing department was expecting that the past Negative CTCs would be returned to our customer's accounts - this has not happened nor after conversations with SCE will it occur.  \u000a\u000aThis complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds.  Primarily EES does not want to pay for Utility charges for our customers while an outstanding Negative CTC balance is due.\u000a\u000aOne key risk with filing this Complaint is that SCE may consolidate this case with the earlier Complaint that is currently on hold.  Probably not too big of a downside.\u000a\u000aWe will be paying the bills into the CPUC for holding until the resolution of the Complaint.\u000a\u000aAny questions or issues please let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7281
aV\u000a\u000aYes, if by Aug 19 we don't have the strategy, we should file.  \u000a\u000aBut we need a comprehensive strategy before the end of the week.  I hope to drive that to conclusion.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7282
aV\u000a\u000aPlease do not contact these customers. \u000a\u000aFYI, <NAME/> signed the following customers after July 1 (we are checking on Wal-Mart).\u000a\u000aI would like Bev and Hedy to rank these parties with their ability to help in Sacramento with our messaging.  Once you have this, let's talk this afternoon to plan going forward.\u000a\u000aAs you can see from the e-mail, we are going to have to work through our business people.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7283

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aWhat's the gas delivery tariff on CGE for generation services?  Do they have a standard service?  Do they have a good generator interconnect agreement on the power side?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7290
aV\u000a\u000aBefore we take this on, let's talk about how it fits into our priorities.  What will be happening that we must cover?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7291
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --  I'll put in a call to discuss with them the contact point.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7292
aV\u000a\u000aA couple questions --\u000a\u000a1.	Could the company include distribution wires as well, instead of being just a transmission only wires?\u000a2.	How many shares would a divesting company get?  Could this be more that 5%?  If so, wouldn't this be over the "control" threshold?\u000a\u000aIn general, I fully support this type of action. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7293
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> -\u000a\u000aI've asked the outside consultants to give us a % change for the impact of the refund case.  Try to give these to you asap.  <NAME/> Alvarez will you please follow up with CRA and Jan Acton?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7294
aV\u000a\u000aMy thoughts --\u000a\u000a1.	Focus more on Tariff standardization (I think that this is the key issue for <NAME/> because LMP based bid balancing market is almost a done deal - and the Texas market seems to be fine for liquidity).  Build around a new proforma with a NETWORK PLUS model.\u000a2.	I would highlight that size matters - re-double our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments.\u000a3.	I would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no source/sink requirement.\u000a4.	The gas / power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration (ie, CNG) but because of the geographic reach.  Many LDCs used Columbia p/l, but only one LDC uses AEPs.  The electric market needs transmission to be "rationalized" across the marketplace so moving power to where it's needed from where it's at.\u000a5.	Should we attack the 209 Boards?  Agree that they are unnecessary, but pls be careful.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7295
aV\u000a\u000aWanted you to see that <NAME/> regarded you highly (my highlights below).  \u000a\u000aAlso, sorry I wasn't very nice on Friday - another very bad day.  I'm sorry.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7299
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, etal --\u000a\u000aNot sure if there is any real "issue" we can push.  Maybe something on the P/L side (see Joe Hartsoe).  Clearly this idea that RTOs will be anti-security is mistaken - it just implies that there should be redundancy of systems.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7300
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aPlease don't forget to get load #s or de-DASR customers - probably 50+%.  Good info to cover our "remaining" customers.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7308
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> -\u000a \u000aI like your #2 and #3 issues for highlighting.  On the issue of fuel diversity, <NAME/> has been somewhat agnostic.  Please draft some comments and share with <NAME/> Hoatson to submit.\u000a \u000aThank you,\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7316
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aAfter our conversation today, I thought that I'd outline some Q&A topics for you to consider --\u000a\u000a1.	How does NERC define "security"? (important to differentiate between national security and system security).\u000a2.	What is NERC's role in national security?\u000a3.	<NAME/> RTOs degrade national security?  system security?\u000a4.	What does <NAME/> think about calls to restrict access to network information such as transmission maps?\u000a5.	Does <NAME/> oppose additional emphasis on securing electricity infrastructure?\u000a\u000aThis Q&A should not be released to the public.  I think this is just to make sure that all of Govt Affairs is on the same page and our DC team has good answers to hard questions.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a

p7319
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> --\u000a\u000aI guess the other big question is this - what is the best argument one could make that any retroactive calculation (and application in a forward-going manner) is illegal?  We need to develop this argument ASAP.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7320
aV\u000a\u000aI'll play the cheap course.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7321
aV\u000a\u000aBefore I send this <NAME/>, I'd like your thoughts.  The element that drives the EA # higher than I would have thought is the large number of people who are working on RTO and NERC only matters.  I've made a decision to assign these people to EA rather than spread to EES.  I could change if you think appropriate.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs some of you may be aware, <NAME/>'s consulting arrangement with <NAME/> ends later this fall.  In an effort to make the transition as easy as possible, I would recommend that the following people work with <NAME/> to transition on critical committees and tasks (nothing is hardwired, so if we need to change people, let me know).\u000a\u000a<NAME/> will attend the upcoming WSCC EPITF meeting (not sure of date, but think in the next two weeks).  My recommendation is that <NAME/> <NAME/> attend with <NAME/> and become the lead.  We may not get a voting seat after <NAME/> leaves, but we should try and cover.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Alvarez should attend the WSCC Board Meeting on Aug 27 with <NAME/> to pick up these responsibilities.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Yeung should pick up coverage for the FlowBased discussions.  <NAME/> will not attend the next meeting in Chicago that takes place on Aug 30.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Rodriguez should pick up the Security Coordinator Subcommitte discussions that take place Sept 25 - 27.  <NAME/> will not attend.\u000a\u000aI think that <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I should attend the NERC Stakeholders Mtg on Oct 15 - 16.\u000a\u000aFinally, <NAME/> Perrino should go with <NAME/> to the next WSCC OCTPG meeting.\u000a\u000aLet me know if this transition plan works.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLooks like this was made more difficult than it needed to be.  The customer wanted a termination letter and because of this we need to kill these deals.  I should have just killed the deals in the first place.  Sorry for the extra work.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p7351
aV\u000a\u000aSorry to hear that.  I hope everything goes well at work.  My company is crumbling.  It's pretty scary.  A combination of being too far out of downtown and too many trees meant that I couldn't get a good signal.  I ended up getting a cable modem.

I guess I'm wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name, but I know the seat location would not be very good.  I really would like to have 4 season ticket seats together.  I have been getting these through you for 6 years now and don't have a problem with just continuing this arrangement.  I also wouldn't be opposed to helping with the contribution to the Foundation if you think it would help.  Let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aNo.  We are going up without tickets.  People who have been say there are usually plenty available.  <NAME/>'t worry about the $.  I don't like ND, but from experience, it is better whent the home team wins.  The LSU-AU game a couple of years ago just wasn't as exciting as AU-Florida or Wisconsin-Minnesota.

aV\u000a\u000aI'm sure you know by know, but <NAME/> got it pretty bad over the weekend.  We were OK, but the flooding was unbelievable.  We were at Lake Conroe (K's parents live on the lake) on Friday night.  It rose at least 3 feet (and it's a big lake!) in a matter of 5 hours.  My boat is on a lift out of the water.  In the morning it was floating.  Their dock is underwater.  I've never seen anything like it.  I hope everyone over there is alright.  Have you seen the newest edition?

aV\u000a\u000aHow goes it?  I hope good.  I just found out that <NAME/> is making Sprint Broadband Direct available to us at a discounted rate.  Isn't this the group you are working for now?  They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?  Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.  Take Care.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI heard you had an email address and wanted to see if it worked.  How are things.  We are pretty wet here, I've heard you are as well.  We got back from Disney World last week.

aV\u000a\u000aHi there,\u000a\u000aThanks for the note.  It is very weird for sure.  I never thought it would happen to <NAME/>.  One of the reasons I didn't go to a smaller shop, even though I was offered more money, was because I didn't want to deal with crap like this.  Lo and behold.  Life is strange.  Anyway, at this point it looks like Dynegy is the suitor for the big E.  I think it will happen.  The question will become, where are we going to be located?  Fortunately, I only have about 8 months left in my contract, so I won't have to put up with too much crap for too long.  We'll see.\u000a\u000aItaly is awesome.  Really really is.  I realize it more and more since I came back.  Tuscany is so cool.  If you go there, go to San Quirico, Montecino and Montepulciano.  Very cool little towns and good wine.  <NAME/> is very cool as well.  I may go back there for a month or so this June if things aren't to wacky.  Have a good time there; I'm envious.\u000a\u000aSounds like you are doing better.  Also sounds like work is fun and challenging.  So do you think you are going to stay there for a while?  Do you miss the West?  I don't think I'll live east of the Rockies, but you never know.\u000a\u000aWell, it looks like this year might be as interesting as last.

aV\u000a\u000aHere are some questions/comments I have regarding the ruling.\u000a\u000a1.  How does the cap apply to index prices.  If the DJ-PV index settles at $120 and the cap is $98, do parties selling index have to adjust there price to $98?\u000a\u000a2.  Would financial products (swaps) be affected by the cap?\u000a\u000a3.  There has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets.  For example, assume it's a Monday and the ISO is under normal conditions and the price is $92.  Then assume on HE 14 the ISO declares a stage one and the price clears at $100 and the price is $100 for the rest of the day.  Tuesday assume the price is $85 during the first few offpeak hours, but the Wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as Monday.  What is the day ahead cash cap trading Tuesday for Wednesday?\u000aIs it $85 or $100?  One could make the argument that it should be $100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on Wednesday, but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one.\u000a\u000aIt seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded.  So for the example, they may recognize it's likely a stage 1 $100 cap will be in effect on Wednesday, so they'll set the cap at $100.  The market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity.  More efficient market, less litigation.\u000a\u000a4.  What about call options?  If a generator owns a call option at $125, the cap is $100, but the market is actually trading $150, does the generator have the right to exercise the option?  What if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at $150.  Does the generator have to wait until the price hits $150?  Seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense.  And would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is a brief personal work history.  I've been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988.  I started trading for Portland General Electric in 1995.  I've been a trader for <NAME/> for the last 4 years.  I run <NAME/>'s short-term Northwest book.  I have market-making responsibility for the cash, balance, and prompt months for the Mid-Columbia and COB specifically, although I am responsible for the entire Northwest.  I also trade Palo Verde, SP15, and NP15.\u000a\u000aI have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this:\u000a\u000a1.  150 K Base Salary\u000a2.  250 to 300 K Signing Bonus\u000a3.  Various bonus structures, generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary.\u000a\u000aQuite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing.  The compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area.

p7415
aV\u000a\u000aHere are my comments\u000a\u000a1.  I wouldn't agree the caps have hurt liquidity.  In fact, in the Northwest at least, they have actually increased liquidity.  Any decrease in liquidity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things (1) uncertainty about the level of the cap and (2) when the day-ahead prices trade above the cap (removing marketers as sellers).\u000a\u000aI would propose the following cap timelines.  First of all, I think it's important that FERC realize the "spot" market really is two separate markets, what we call the "day-ahead" cash markets, and "day-of" real-time markets.  The 24-hour designation doesn't dovetail with the current market timelines and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and dispatch of power plants.  For example, day-ahead cash typically trades from 6:00 am to approximately 7:00 am for next day deliveries.  However, on Thursdays the WSCC OTC market trades for Friday and Saturday deliveries, and on Fridays, we trade for Sunday and Monday (all of this can be adjusted for various reasons, but this is the typical schedule).  If we held to the 24-hour spot cap literally, then Tuesday thru Friday the cap would apply to the day-ahead market, but would not apply to Saturday and Monday.  This obviously cannot be an intended consequence.  I recommend the cap timeline be consistent with the day-ahead WSCC OTC trading timelines.\u000a\u000aIn addition, there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the day-ahead market.  What if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that real-time markets will be trading above the 85% threshold?  Assume that stage I, II or even III is a certainty.  It seems prudent that a higher day-ahead price cap be established (still consistent with FERC's guidelines).  Why?  Because you would want units prescheduled to have high reserve margins going into real-time, rather than scrambling to dispatch units real-time.  It seems like it would be prudent for some independent board to set the day-ahead price cap equal to either the 85% or Stage I limit prior to trading time.  This board would have to have regional representatives in order to be truly effective.  Establishing the cap does not have to be cumbersome or time consuming, in fact, it should be fairly easy.\u000a\u000aThe cap governing real-time transactions is clear.  However, what isn't clear is what happens when the new Stage I cap is actually lower than the existing 85% of stage I cap.  For example, during the first couple of days in July the real-time cap was operating under the 85% of Stage 1 criteria, approximately $92.  The ISO hit a Stage I and Stage II and the price actually fell to the $70s.  This created uncertainty exactly when it shouldn't happen.  As a result supply was apparently affected in California and the Southwest for a few hours across the peak.  It seems odd that prices should fall real-time as reserve margins decrease.  One could argue this is a good reason why caps should be tied to daily gas prices, but assuming that isn't an option, I propose something like this:  The DAY BEFORE (around 2200) the CAISO, or preferably an independent body, would determine the real-time non-Stage cap as well as a Stage minimum.  While in a stage I, II, or III the hourly price would be the HIGHER of the non-stage price cap OR the recalculated Stage price.  If the Stage I price turned out lower, then the non-stage price would be used for that hour, but the recalculated Stage I cap (and corresponding 85% price) would apply for the NEXT operating day, and for day-ahead cash trading for the next trade day.  This provides information before the trading period (enhancing liquidity) and eliminates strange price movements during real-time.  It also fits the FERC price cap paradigm.\u000a\u000a2.  Marketer prices.  I think there is a clear bias against marketers in the order.  But given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketers, there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recover costs that are easily demonstrable.  First would be losses at a tie into California.  If we sell at the cap and incurr losses, then we can't sell at the cap.  Second would be the 10% credit premium.  Credit issues apply whether you're a marketer or generator.  Third would be call options.  It seems if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option, that a party should be able to exercise and sell.  I'm not sure what the difference between a peaking plant and a call option is.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis gets even better.  On Tuesday, April 3, I had our California prescheduler ask the ISO Day Ahead personnel why the COB S/N ATC had been decreased so much.  There reply was that the ATC is calculated by taking the TTC less Existing Transmission Contracts less FTRs less Capacity Benefit Margin.  Normally, and up until January 1 of this year, they haven't used a Capacity Benefit Margin when calculating ATC leaving the state.  So the amount of ATC they had at COB S/N is normally in the 700 to 800 MW range, rather than the 35 to 60 MW of ATC they are using now.\u000a\u000aWe asked what this Capacity Benefit Margin was, and they said it's not in their tariff, it's in the NERC Operating Manual.  I went to the NERC web site, and sure enough, Capacity Benefit Margin is a defined term.  It reads : "Capacity Benefit Margin is the amount of TTC reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements".\u000a\u000aThe ISO's use of this language is outrageous.  This is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation.  I can see them using this argument with respect to COB N/S but no way COB S/N!!  In fact, one could very easily argue that they are VIOLATING this criteria.  If we have load in the Northwest, and have purchased generation in California, we should have access to available transmission.\u000a

The data were obtained from the ISO.\u000aAfter looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.\u000a\u000aI propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via <NAME/> <NAME/>) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey there!\u000a\u000aHow's it going?  I understand you guys stole one of our marketers.  That's ok, I'll forgive you.  Things are insanely boring here.  Basically we are in a wait mode, probably, I think, until February.  This is the first time in 5 years I haven't had to worry about P&L and I have to say it's pretty weird.  It's nice sleeping in though.\u000a\u000aSo supposedly we have 14 potential suitors. You've probably heard of the banks, and I've also heard Reliant is putting together a bid.  THAT would be interesting.  We laid off probably half the people in our office--pretty much all back office support and some conservation/renewable people.  Bad timing.  Plus, when we laid off <NAME/> Broadband folks, they got a six month severance package, and EBB didn't make any money, and in fact lost a substantial amount.  Then <NAME/> lays off people on our floor, which has made a phenomenal amount of money, and gives them basically $4,000 taxed at 48%.  Life is not fair.\u000a\u000aIt's going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry.  I think the California debacle, then <NAME/> (now Calpine), is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward.  Credit is going to become more and more an issue, especially towards the back of the curve.  It's interesting, I remember 5 years ago the prediction was, when it was all said and done, there would be 6 big energy suppliers in the country.  Looks like it's heading that way.\u000a\u000aSo are you going to Europe?  Sounds like fun.  If it looks like we're going to be on the sidelines for a while, I might go on vacation for a couple of weeks, maybe Hawaii.\u000a\u000aWell, I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee.  I hope everything is well with you.\u000a\u000aTake care,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Prior to that, I cash traded for Portland General for a couple of years.  My contract with <NAME/> is up July 31, and I have a 3-month non-compete obligation.  Theoretically, the earliest I could leave <NAME/> would be May 31, so the earliest I could start with another shop would be Sept 1.\u000a\u000aTo be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  I'm talking to a couple of other outfits and I basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there.  I talked with <NAME/>, and he mentioned you, so I thought it might be a good idea to get in touch.  If you are interested in pursuing anything further, please e-mail me and we'll arrange a time we can talk over the phone.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAttached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly TTC and ATC data for COB S/N from Jan 1, 2000 to April 2001.  The data were obtained from the ISO.\u000aAfter looking at the data, it is clear that, although the TTC values have not changed from '00 to '01, the ATC values have decreased dramatically.  I believe the reason for this is the ISO's attempt to prevent exports to the Northwest.\u000a\u000aI propose that we send this spreadsheet to our ISO rep (via <NAME/> <NAME/>) and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aMy apologies for not getting back sooner, but I sort of wanted to see how the <NAME/> real-time products did before proceeding with this.  It seems like real-time is a success, so let's get going with this. \u000a\u000aI call this product DART (Day-Ahead/Real-Time).  It's basically a physical product that is transacted on a day-ahead cash basis, but is delivered on real-time.  For example, on the day-ahead, lets say I post a "US Pwr Phy Firm  Mid-C Peak Oct04 to Oct05 DART"  $27 at $28.  If I get hit, then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on Oct 5th, real-time 25 MW each hour.  I would be long real-time at $27.  If a party lifts my $28, then I would be obligated to deliver to them on Oct 5, real-time, 25 MW each hour.  I would be short at $28.\u000a\u000aThe mechanics of this deal are much like a regular day-ahead cash transaction.  The primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular day-ahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled.\u000a\u000aAs far as the product language goes, I think if you add the following language to what you provided below, we should be OK (obviously subject to legal review).\u000a\u000a"This product is intended to be transacted on a Day-Ahead basis, for delivery on a Real-Time basis.  Day Ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery, consistent with WSCC scheduling and trading practices.  Real-time means the actual Delivery Day.  Real-time deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted WSCC scheduling timelines and practices."\u000a\u000aTake a look, give me a call.  Thanks.\u000a
p7431
aV\u000a\u000aI've had an idea for a new EOL product that I would like to start our EOL legal and contracts people thinking about.  It's kind of a weird product, but I think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was.\u000a\u000aIt's called the Day Ahead/Real-Time Park/Lend product.  Essentially it's a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time.  For example, let's say Morgan <NAME/> agrees to sell us 25 MW onpeak for $25, but that it is not prescheduled--it is to be settled real time.  If we fast forward to real-time, Morgan <NAME/> has two options.  They can buy from us on EOL, whereby this transaction books out, or they can deliver us physical power, whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time.  The nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time, even if they are not a control area.  In addition, it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a day-ahead position.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I'm not sure if it's you I need to talk to about this, but I would appreciate some direction if it's somebody else.  Once we identify who we need to look at this, I'd like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and EOL mechanics.\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey,\u000a\u000aYou sound kind of bummed out there, amiga.  Understandable though.  Tough and very weird times that's for sure.  Very sad.  The funerals must have been brutal.  I know I'm depressed by it because I get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically.  Hopefully things will improve.\u000a\u000aOur stock has just been munched.  It sucks because we're doing well, but the other "half" of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors.  Everyone was wondering why Skilling left; I guess we know why now.\u000a\u000aEnough of the gloom and doom.  Sounds like you are getting opportunities--that's good.  I knew that you would.  Here's some pros/cons for your options (recalling my vast experience;))  Structuring:  Interesting but not alot of dough.  Probably the most easily replaced by those fresh MBAs.  Trading:  Like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed.  Can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times.  Good dough if you make it though.  Marketing:  Low immediate, constant stress, but still competitive.  You have a great deal of charm and brains, so I think you would do quite well in this area.  In addition, there are a number of firms (Calpine, AEP, Coral) who are opening up an office in Portland pretty much geared towards mid-marketing.  Might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home (plus you can buy me beer, which is always a plus for anyone's karma).\u000a\u000aAs far as your overall attitude towards the industry, I think I disagree.  I think it's a good industry to be in, particularly now, because no matter what, people need electricity.  And it's still changing, especially out West, so there will be challenges and opportunities.\u000a\u000aIt's great talking with you.  Cheer up.  Call your folks.  Run.  Punch a punching bag.  Do drugs (kidding).  Take care of yourself, and if you need anything, give me a buzz or drop an email.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aToday is a good time.  E-mail me with a number I can reach you at, a time, and I'll give you a call from my cell phone.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOn August 16, 2001, <NAME/> counsel in DC requested that the <NAME/> Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, <NAME/>'s internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.\u000a\u000aThe amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing <NAME/>'s comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  <NAME/> was instrumental in bridging this gap.\u000a\u000aAs a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that <NAME/> receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Crandall\u000a\u000a\u000a(<NAME/>.  Is this good enough?)\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDow Jones is interested as well.  I really think a hourly index would be very useful; price discovery, financial positions, etc.\u000a
p7443
aV\u000a\u000aYou are right.  There are no delivery/scheduling obligations on the day ahead DART product (unlike the regular day-ahead).  Yes.  A DART onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day, and a DART offpeak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day.\u000a
p7444
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aThe difference is because I rounded the purchase prices from AEP and Avista in the P&L spreadsheet, rather than taking a weighted average.  The wire request amount is correct.\u000a
p7445
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere are the examples we talked about\u000a\u000aAssumptions:\u000a\u000a1.  EOL and Broker market:  COB $30 @ $40.\u000a2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7.\u000a3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.\u000a\u000aHere's what will happen in the broker market:\u000a\u000a(A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31.\u000a(B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.\u000a\u000aIf you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:\u000a\u000a(C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A))\u000a(D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).\u000a\u000aClearly this doesn't work.\u000a\u000aOne possible solution, I think, is to examine what happens if you put out a COB/MC product on EOL, but switch the products such that Product 1 = MC and Product 2 = COB, and assume we put the underlying Product 1 market out as MC $30 @ $40.\u000a\u000a(E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want).\u000a(F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).\u000a\u000aI realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.\u000a\u000aIf you have any questions, let me know.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAttached are my final comments.  They deal more with the proposal to curtail exports (including muni).  I don't really care if we file this with the material we have already put together, or do something with it separately.  With respect to the ATC and TTC questions we were addressing earlier, I haven't added anything to what <NAME/> put together.  The CAISO's argument about restricting ATC because of Path 15 congestion, because, as <NAME/> points out, any technical problems would affect both TTC AND ATC.  If anyone has any questions, let me know\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe've been experimenting with spreads on EOL and I want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on EOL.\u000a\u000aAssume you want to put out the COB/MC spread -4 at 4.  Also assume COB is 275 at 300.  As you know, if you put this out in the broker market, you would expect to buy COB $4 under Mid-C or sell COB $4 over.\u000a\u000aIf you want to duplicate these trades on EOL you could put out COB/MC -4 at 4, but here is what's going to happen (assume COB mid is 287.5).  If somebody 'hits' your 'bid' you will sell COB at 287.5 and buy Mid-C at 283.5.  If somebody 'lifts' your 'offer' you will buy  COB at 287.5 and sell MC at 291.5.  Effectively the EOL transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid, or the title is COB/MC but the transaction is MC/COB.  The problem it seems to me is that, fundamentally, bid is always first, offer is second.  For this to work as is, the market would have to accept that, in all cases bid/offer applies except with EOL spreads where it's offer/bid.\u000a\u000aThis seems too confusing to me.  I'm not sure how you guys feel about  it, but I want to give you a heads up.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAttached is the memo I promised.  It's sort of rough, but accurate.  Please feel free to utilize any or all of it.  It would be interesting to get <NAME/> <NAME/>'s feedback as well.  Also, this doesn't really address my concerns with respect to curtailing firm exports under muni-transmission (at least not completely).   If you have any questions, let me know.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI've been talking with <NAME/> over the last couple of weeks about possible opportunities at <NAME/>.  Just to give you a quick look at my background, I've been running <NAME/>'s short-term Northwest desk for about 4 years.  Prior to that, I performed more or less the same function with PGE for a couple of years.  My contract with <NAME/> is up July 31.  I'm under a 3-month noncompete obligation after I leave <NAME/>.  Theoretically, my last day with <NAME/> could be May 31, so the first day I'd be able to start somewhere else would be Sept 1.\u000a\u000aTo be honest, at this point I'm shopping.  My goal is to have 3-4 options to consider by May 31.  I'll be in Salt Lake on May 4, so if you are interested in getting together to talk about any opportunities <NAME/> might have, please let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI spoke with <NAME/> about your proposed changes and he was okay with your first change, however,  the definition of "Investment Policy" does appear in Section 5(c)(i).  What documentation sets forth your investment objectives, restrictions, etc.?\u000a\u000aAlso, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached to the ISDA?\u000a\u000aFinally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal opinion.\u000a\u000aThank you for your assistance.\u000a

p7606
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aAttached are forms of resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage agreements, together with a form of authorized traders list.  I don't know if <NAME/> told you or not, but we typically require two signatories to open brokerage accounts.  Presently, our resolutions reflect <NAME/> Schultz, Vice President of Risk Assessment and Control Group, a Division of <NAME/> Corp. as being authorized, however, we have just learned that she hasn't been officially elected to this office, so in the interim, we will have <NAME/> Buy be our second signature.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.\u000a
p7607
aV\u000a\u000aI think it will be okay for them to sign.  They will need to print and sign two originals and return both copies to you.  Both <NAME/> and <NAME/> will need to initial before the agreements can be signed by an authorized officer.  Additionally, our notice information will need to be completed.  Once signed by Uecomm and returned to you, please let me know so that we can process the <NAME/> Corp. guaranty or will <NAME/> process it from your end?  Also, I don't know if you will keep the original in Australia or if it will come back to <NAME/>.  Robbi, do you know?  We can cross that bridge once it is fully executed.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> this isn't too confusing!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p7620
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aCan you help me respond to <NAME/>'s e-mail?  I think her question is did the below transaction remain on ECT's US books or was it back to backed with the UK?  I think there is a tax question.\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

We can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for Dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated, however if they think it works - fine.  We would not want the margin calculated net (it needs to be exclusive of this transaction).  If they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement, there is an accounting issue for us.\u000a\u000a2.  In the East we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools.  We are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools.  So we do not need to do anything.  I'll have the west soon. \u000a\u000a3.  We will have our physical gas position by point soon.  We will agree to prepay for all of Dec but we should only pay day by day.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTuesday - 10:00 to 12:00 - is the all-employee meeting at the Hyatt.  Given negative publicity over the last several days and the dramatic market reaction (stock price today down to $20), the meeting tomorrow should be well attended and I would expect that the questions will be quite candid.  MD's had a meeting this morning with Lay, Whalley and Frevert, and we made suggestions on what should be covered in the all-employee meeting.  \u000a\u000aI have dropped out of my recruiting trip to Oklahoma tomorrow so that I can be present at the Hyatt meeting.  Since <NAME/> and <NAME/> are both travelling, I think that it is important to both <NAME/> Lay and employees for us to have a visible prescence at the meeting.  As a follow up, I am pulling together a group of senior leaders within ENW at noon for an informal lunch (in the conference room without door handles!). We will discuss what we heard at the all-employee meeting and how to anticipate employee questions and deal with the possibililty of low morale.  I will stress the importance of visible, consistant leadership at this time, and will ask all to do their part on this.  I discussed this with <NAME/> Piper this morning, and he suppports this effort.\u000a\u000aWho do you want to have attend the lunch folllow-up meeting?

aV\u000a\u000aGot your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.  By copy of this memo to <NAME/> Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  \u000a\u000aI have a lunch meeting scheduled with <NAME/> Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the <NAME/> Estate that I believe has a lot of merit.  As you may know, one of our business goals within <NAME/> Net Works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services.  With the money and talent that has been poured into <NAME/>'s trading operations systems and processes, we believed that there could be market demand for these services.  Ironically enough, we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on December 1.  Understandably, the customer became concerned during November and the deal was shelved.  Our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services (coupling our systems and our people), but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed <NAME/> that was offering these services.  The market place didn't want us to "win again" as <NAME/>. \u000a\u000aObviously, the world has changed.  While effort is currently focused on the formation of Netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within EGM, EIM, EA, EES, etc., I think that we would short-change the Estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the Estate.  The idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm, which could provide some capital, additional resource pool and a ready sales channel.  With the potential of spin-off companies from <NAME/> and with former <NAME/> employees taking jobs with other firms, many doors would be opened for this "independent" services company to provide services.  Servicing the <NAME/> Estate could be the first engagement for this services company.  Depending upon the structure of the deal, benefits to the <NAME/> Estate could be reduced costs for systems and services, perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the CommodityLogic tools,  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements, etc.  Another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals, this would create a true career opportunity - a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm - making it much more likely that these people could be retained. \u000a\u000a<NAME/> and I met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept.  There is definite interest, so we discussed the idea with <NAME/> Piper today.  We asked him for clarification around the Netco agreement regarding systems, and I believe that he has copied you on a note to <NAME/> Koehler regarding this.  Our ability to process transactions is one of <NAME/>'s assets, and our hope would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the Netco agreement has been drafted. \u000a\u000aThe next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the Estate's consideration.  <NAME/> and I would like to move forward with the proposal stage.  It would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal.  If we as <NAME/> felt that there is merit to the proposal, would there simply be an approval process with the Creditor's Committee and the Court?  Would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal?  To set expectations within the consulting firm, it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process. \u000a\u000aYour thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well.  --<NAME/>\u000a

I know that <NAME/> is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.  I have e-mailed <NAME/> Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.  While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.  \u000a\u000aLet me know when you will be back in <NAME/>.  If you like Mexican food, I can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am so glad that you joined us for dinner, as well.  I noticed that the <NAME/> jokingly said that the scholarship checks were "in the mail".  The University does send those checks to the students, so please let me know if you have not received that.  \u000a\u000aIt was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner.  Please keep me posted on your plans after graduation.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Shanker called today and wants to spend Tuesday through Thursday next week in our office reviewing at a more detailed level the functional responsibilities within Operations and Accounting.  His goal, on behalf of <NAME/> Bisignano (which I am sure that I have misspelled), is to map the job functions that we have into the job functions as they are organized within <NAME/> Smith <NAME/>.  \u000a\u000aI told him that we would be glad to work with him.  We will involve <NAME/> Hall, <NAME/> Gossett, <NAME/> White, <NAME/> Reeves and others as needed in these more detailed discussions.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> says that <NAME/> is sending him a functional org chart for his team today.  I will touch base with <NAME/> to make sure we are coordinated on our efforts.    \u000a\u000aIs this the entity that had requested org charts that you asked for?  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7825
aV\u000a\u000aThat was my third or fourth time at Ibeza - I have enjoyed it each time.  It is a great place for outside dining when the weather works for that.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDid the numbers that we gave you yesterday on Operations hold up after your meeting with UBS?\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Fitzpatrick is calling me to get names.  Our primary focus yesterday was on number of positions.  We identified names in most cases, but not all.  Before that is finalized and I pass names along to <NAME/>, I wanted to know if we were okay with the numbers.   Please let me know.  Names can be finalized this afternoonis we are set on numbers.    \u000a\u000a--<NAME/>\u000ax35926\u000a\u000aCell:  713-417-1591\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIs this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for them, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th - I'd like to put that on my calendar.  Does <NAME/> know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7828
aV\u000a\u000aUp to you and <NAME/>.  We have already done a meeting in 3AC - today at 11:15.  We had not been provided info that <NAME/> had anyone in 3AC.  We had a meeting this morning during which we reviewed floor meeting plans - I don't think that <NAME/> was able to attend.  \u000a \u000aYour options are to bring them over to ECN 14 at 1:30, or to have them attend a meeting at 1:00 in 2 <NAME/> Center, 12 th floor in the Forum (a meeting room on that floor). I will be conducting that floor meeting at 1:00 for ENW employees in 2 <NAME/> Center - it is <NAME/> Sommers' ISC group.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7829
aV\u000a\u000aThanks.  Sorry, we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes.  Lots of time on budgets - still continuing this week.  What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .  Thanks. --<NAME/>\u000a
p7830
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> would be good and I do believe that he is an asset.  I will talk with <NAME/> and see what we can suggest. \u000a\u000aWith regard to your comment that I am "in", in my conversation with <NAME/> Whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like <NAME/> Haedicke, and perhaps himself, there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately.  What I agreed to with <NAME/> is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in 30 to 60 days.  In the meantime, I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction.  I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes, systems, staff expertise and operational controls.  And you can also count on me if I can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for Netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Reeves will be getting the org charts to <NAME/> this afternoon before she leaves.  Gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts, as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts. \u000a\u000a--<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a713-417-1591\u000a\u000aIt's about 6:45 pm right now - I need to spend 15 minutes or so on open items on my desk, then I will be headed home.  Commute takes about 35 minutes this time of night.  Try me in the car about 7:15 pm tonight and I can fill you in during my commute.  Feel free to call me at home tonight as well.  Best after 9:30 pm - 281-370-8568.  Other option will be during my commute tomorrow morning.  Try me in the car about 7:15 am.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your note.  I have sent a message to <NAME/> Apollo, who is <NAME/>' supervisor.  <NAME/> is out for the next two days, and will return to the office on Wednesday.  I will make sure that <NAME/> and <NAME/> make a point of talking with you about this opportunity.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7833
aV\u000a\u000aIn re-reading this, I noticed that <NAME/> Hall was included in the distribution list.  He is the only one from <NAME/>'s team included.  Do you want to copy <NAME/> as well, or was <NAME/>'s inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the MPR, which now is managed by <NAME/> Ayala.  Either way, you may want to include <NAME/> on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive.  \u000a\u000aWhat about Georgeanne Hodges?  Should she be notified as well?  You may also want to copy <NAME/> as an FYI.  Thanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7836
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for copying me on <NAME/> Brown's note.  <NAME/> Herod flew to London last night and should be in the London office today.  I am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this.  She and I visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in London for the pulp and paper effort.  So as to not steal her thunder, it will suffice to say that I am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing EGM model.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7837
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each.  The outline that I sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set.  The schedule that we have been working with that <NAME/> provided did not allocate two hours for the Friday meeting.  If you had set aside two hours, that had not been communicated to us.  There were only two one-hour meeting slots on that schedule.  One for ENW from 1-2 and one for Research from 3-4.  I have a major conflict on Friday - I committed months ago to attend a meeting that <NAME/> Lay asked to be involved in that is in the Woodlands that runs through the evening hours..  Only because <NAME/> Perlman is out on Thursday for a religious holiday, I decided to "skip out" from this meeting to be here on Friday afternoon to discuss the Operations and IT Development budgets together.  In order to minimize my time away from the Woodlands meeting, I orchestrated the time swap with <NAME/> Kaminiski so that we could have our ENW meeting at 3:00.  I will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for <NAME/> Lay.  Maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us.  I would appreciate your help on that, <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aScheduling issues aside, <NAME/> suggested that we also review with you the EES budget that ENW has prepared.  Our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that ENW provides to support the EES business.  We have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses - EES or EA.  That is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs.  We are prepared, however, with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes.  I have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for EES and ENW.  If you would like to cover all of ENW's budgets together, both for EES and EA, then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time (maybe 3 hours?).  I will bring my schedule to our meeting at 11:00 today to cover the Canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us. \u000a\u000aWe will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction, but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects.  Our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our "scope of engagement" discussion.  A service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement.  We will have a straw man for discussion on that.    --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>: \u000a\u000aThanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk.  We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involved in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.  Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of <NAME/>'s businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? \u000a\u000aI suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complementing, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being piloted in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA audits, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other Thursday with you and <NAME/> Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cover this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. \u000a\u000aI might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quantifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-developed operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unit/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatives. \u000a\u000aFinally, the second bullet point in <NAME/>'s list below is already being addressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure that information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate and efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spanning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with <NAME/> Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, resource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of stakeholders from Operations, IT and <NAME/> Brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with <NAME/> Port and <NAME/> <NAME/> for final input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for <NAME/> and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the <NAME/>'s list.  We can certainly update the cross-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new team to focus on this bullet point. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFBI agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new <NAME/> garage Wednesday through Friday this week (#450).  The spot is clearly marked reserved, and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space.   I have left a polite note on the intruding car on Thursday and Friday, asking that the Reserved status be observed, as there are many unused, non-reserved parking spaces in the garage.  \u000a\u000aI have put up with this for 3 days.  If the FBI will be back here next week, however, I will grow tired of this.  Is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the Reserved parking spaces?  \u000a\u000aI know that you have bigger issues at hand, but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended, that I will be paying for a Reserved parking space that I never get to use!  \u000a\u000aThanks.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI realize that the timing of the <NAME/> Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with <NAME/> Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> budget focus for today beginning in a few minutes is to have our act together for the Delainey/Dietrich EES review tomorrow - <NAME/> Dayao, <NAME/> Apollo and Kerry Roper will join me for a walk through. \u000a\u000aFinalizing EIM budget will likely not get done today.  Can give you the details on why later today.  <NAME/> become obvious.\u000a\u000aJust meet with Shankman and McConnell.  Not ready to finalize EGM budget yet.  They say that their commercial guys are waiting for <NAME/> Johnson to get with them on details of IT development projects.  I think that <NAME/> has been out for a few days, but I did see him on the 3rd floor when I was down there with Shankman and McConnell.  I will leave him a voice mail message to get an update on outstanding issues from his point of view.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> want to have their stuff finalized by Friday.  I will convey that timeline to <NAME/> Johnson.\u000a\u000aAfter EES budget prep meeting this afternoon, next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond EA to other commodities.  High priorty and very short time fuse on this one, for reasons that should be obvious.  I will have all of the Operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon, along with Ramesh Rao and others in IT who may be required to help us extract necessary info. \u000a\u000aNice way of telling you, <NAME/>, that I understand your desire for a page of footnotes with budget explanations for Whalley, and that in my opinion that falls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today.  I will work with Kerry on this.  I can tell you, however, that updates on budgets are not top on anyone's lists today, including Whalley's.  We will honor your commitment to get him updated information, and will provide as much detail as possible.  Best approach given the state of business today may be to provide him with the high level overview (that one page of expense and capital), state where we are in the review process with each business unit, and highlight reductions in expense and capital to date.   We can continue to provide updates to Whalley as the EES, EIM, EGM and EBS (yes, I need to coordinate with <NAME/> P. when he is back on some changes here - confidential at this point).  <NAME/>'t know how useful detailed footnotes will be for Whalley before we truly finalize the various business unit budgets.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a \u000aI got the e-mail last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for Operations, inclusive of Power and Gas Logistics.  (The tabs total 184 with one Associate noted on a separate line in Power Logistics, and 183 without that Associate, so I don't know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the Operations total.) Taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change - 45.6% reduction.  At this moment, I don't know how feasible that is.  But I will work with <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> to find out.\u000a \u000aWe  need some questions answered first to go through this:\u000a \u000a1)  Who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for Gas and Power Logistics?  Together, those groups represent 25% of the 184 headcount.  Going in, I would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions - should be 21 reductions.  We need to know who we should work with to coordinate this.  Need names and weekend contact numbers.\u000a \u000a2)  What will the overall headcount be for Netco?  What we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes.  If commercial numbers don't change and the business scope doesn't change, a 45.6% reduction is probably out of the question.  \u000a \u000a3)  Is the 100 number for Operations only a start-up number?  Could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up, approval is obtained for physical gas business, etc.?  Or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002?\u000a \u000a4)  What are UBS' expectations for mid and back office?  What are the views from Legal and UBS on creating confirmations for EOL transactions?  There were some discussions with <NAME/> Reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions.  One firm, and I don't remember whether it was UBS or not, mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions, and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations.  That is a completely different activity than we normally engage in, and would make a difference in staffing - perhaps requiring more people!   We need to know those things from UBS to take a real stab at a revised number.  Should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with UBS, or is there someone with UBS that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required?\u000a \u000a5)  Does the internal RAC group go forward under a headcount reduction - i.e. will we be coordinating and providing information to them, or will UBS assume some of their functions?  This may impact our staffing needs.  What about consolidated risk reporting - will <NAME/> and <NAME/> simply transmit data to UBS, or Netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to UBS?\u000a \u000aWe may have more questions, but these are key now to get at a feasible number.  \u000a \u000a--<NAME/>\u000a

I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  \u000a\u000aHowever, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in <NAME/>.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that <NAME/> Herod and <NAME/> Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona <NAME/> and Thresa <NAME/> as directors.  I have asked <NAME/> to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution.  \u000aThanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe may have a few more transfers given the final decision on the management of the settlements function.  We had a lunch meeting with <NAME/> Lavorato, <NAME/> Delainey, <NAME/>, etc. on Thursday last week, and will have fleshed out a the details of a proposal later this week that would move the management of the settlements function under EWS and leave the service management component (<NAME/> Hughes) under EES.

I know that there were ten invitations needed, including Mom and Dad.  The list below plus those in this paragraph total 8 - so we must be missing 2.  \u000a\u000aI will try to catch <NAME/> and have him look at the list that I copied from Mom.  \u000a\u000aThanks for these.

aV\u000a\u000aThanks so much for your note.  I have assumed my new role as COO right at budget time, so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000, I have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under <NAME/> Net Works, another 2500 people that deliver our IT infrastructure, our system maintenance and development projects and our e-commerce platforms.  The learning curve is steep right now, but fun!\u000a\u000aYour association with Vanderbilt sounds interesting.  CIndy is keeping me abreast of your project.  I sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you.  \u000a\u000aWhile everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks, I can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in New York.  My thoughts are with you and your family.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere are the two for <NAME/>.  Please get copies of resumes from <NAME/>.  Please set up a meeting for later this week with all who will be supervisors of interns.  Include <NAME/> as well.  Thanks.  (thirty minutes will be fine)\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and RPS and RGS.  My understanding is that <NAME/> Taylor on your team is working on this interface.  What is the expected completion of this interface, and if is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.  With the large number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem.  Can you call me today with an update?  Thanks. -<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGood question.  All cash outflows have an impact, so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars.  We have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel (is it really necessary, and if so, can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons), off-site meetings (can an <NAME/> conference room work just fine), happy hours (should get approved by <NAME/>, <NAME/> or me ahead of time, and we need to be comfortable with business purpose), outside services and hiring.  I think that you could share this with the assistants.  \u000a\u000aIt is very important, especially now, to have updated contact information for employees.  All assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are up-to-date.  \u000a\u000aPlease thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times.  I will let you know if I think of anything else regarding spending.  --<NAME/> \u000a\u000aJust thought of this:  We should have all approvers within the "ibuyit" and "ibuyit-payables" systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments.  Assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system.  We should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAll eight students that we interviewed for the <NAME/> Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  <NAME/>'s letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe November newsletter looked great!  \u000a\u000aThis message was sent by <NAME/> Gibson for the December newsletter.  At Monday's board meeting, <NAME/> Ewalt gave me an article about Senior Presentation for the December newsletter.  She doesn't have an electronic copy.  I will try this weekend to retype it as a word document and e-mail it to you.  <NAME/> also said that she had given <NAME/> Petrak a hard copy of a permission slip to be printed in the December newsletter.  (This is for parents to sign for under 17's to be out after midnight as they return from Senior Presentation).  Do you have that?  If not, you might contact <NAME/> and ask her for that.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI have an ENW budget review meeting with EGM (McConnell and Shankman) set for 1:30 to 2:30 on October 15th.

aV\u000a\u000aOnly a week and a half to reply to you - I apologize!   The artickale was great.  In fact, today I have resent the notice with the hot link to my direct reports.  Since we all get so many e-mails, I wanted to be certain that this wasn't overlooked.  I pointed out to them that ENN had broadened its cover to include operations as well as technology, and that they should look for upcoming articles.  \u000a\u000aSounds as if your son had a strong start at Kleb as well.  This second six weeks is proving to be a little more challenging for <NAME/> - or her effort may have gotten diverted!  \u000a\u000aI am copying my assistant on this note so that we can get lunch on the calendar.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aBig Pig:\u000a\u000aMet with them today and gave an overview of Operations.  All went well.   The CFO asked about performance measurements regarding costs per transaction.  I described the Operations Pricing Model that I implemented several years ago.  They were also interested in our ability to handle increased transaction flow, and I mentioned that through the OPM we were able to track the increased operational efficiencies that we experienced with the increase in transaction flow.  The CFO asked to get some information regarding OPM.  I have a summary report that reflects the decrease in cost per transaction plotted against the increase in transaction counts.  This is not currently included in the data room.   Do you want to review this before I pass it along to <NAME/> Zipper to provide to the CFO?  \u000a\u000a\u000aUBS:\u000a\u000aEddie Pittarelli (Head of Operations for UBS) called today to reconfirm the numbers of operations personnel slated for Newco.  The spreadsheets that you had forwarded to me <NAME/> (through <NAME/> Fitzpatrick on December 19) totaled 172 for Operations, which included 32 for Gas Logistics.  Eddie said that he was going into a meeting tonight where UBS would again discuss their level of interest.  He wanted to know if the Operations staff was still primarily in tact, and I confirmed that is the case.  Told him that the leads on Gas Risk, Gas Logistics, Power Risk, Settlements and Documentation were all here in place.  He said that depending on the outcome of the meeting tonight that he plans to be in <NAME/> within the next few days.  FYI.\u000a

We are glad that she is there to provide some continuity on historical data, but all historical data and forward actions must be confirmed with <NAME/>.  Let me know if you would like me to underscore this with <NAME/>, and I will be glad to.  Might be a good idea to send a note to <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> stating that legal has named <NAME/> as the point person, but that for appropriate continuity and execution that <NAME/> must be fully involved - and that you have asked <NAME/> to make that part of her responsibility.  Copy <NAME/> on the note.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOur current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%.  I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders.  Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow.   We are in agreement, as <NAME/> Hall has worked with <NAME/>'s team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).  <NAME/> and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects.  The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what <NAME/>'s team is focused on tonight.  \u000a\u000a--<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch  - our list of senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.  I thought that <NAME/> was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.  I asked <NAME/> to verify his title and to find out if he was in <NAME/> this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.  Does he report to you?  <NAME/> that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has close to 300 people reporting to him.  The largest segment is the service management team.  My understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers.  We will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale, and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions.  I don't think we are in danger of getting <NAME/> back.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7896
aV\u000a\u000aRealistically, only the trading support provided for straight-forward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode.  I would say that the only part of IT Development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees.  Capital projects don't make sense on a cost per transaction basis - should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and ENW agree upon. \u000a\u000aWhile we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction, I still have concerns about this on a lot of levels.  Frankly, the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the EOL relationship.  If we are boxed into a cost per transaction, then whenever <NAME/> Lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of P&L, we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly.  Practically speaking, there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isn't needed yesterday, and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired!  I also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement.  I will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people.  The guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of EA in mind.   They work hard to insure success for EA.  That is what <NAME/> and <NAME/> should want.  Push us back too far and no one will like the results if we don't have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support.  It is kind of ironic.  I think that <NAME/> is pleased with how I've managed operations, and one of my goals when I took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for <NAME/>.  I have some really good people who are very motivated, and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at EA, EGM, EIM, etc.  We had to work hard to achieve that, but we've gotten there for the most part.  So how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contributor to the success that we have had.  EES is reeling right now partly because they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team, nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their business in full.  And now I have been asked to help correct that.  Makes you kind of wonder...\u000a\u000aI am fully supportive of running operations (and ENW) like a business, with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively.  When I first took this role I told my team that at that time we were the service provider of circumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the service provider of choice.  A component of this is definitely striving for lower costs and higher value delivered.  We can continue to improve on this, but going too far may produce the wrong answer for <NAME/>.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOur meeting with EIM is set for Monday, October 12th from 9:00 to 10:30.  <NAME/> Bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with <NAME/> Sweeney - <NAME/> just initiated that meeting himself with <NAME/> one day last week, spur of the moment.  But that is the only meeting regarding ENW budgets that has taken place.  I have been working with <NAME/> Castleman (EIM's CAO) since last week to arrange our meeting now set for Monday.  \u000a\u000aI think that by "agreed plan", McMahon just means that is the amount that at this point EIM is saying they are willing to take.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is a copy of the presentation that <NAME/> Superty made to the Peoples Energy Board this week.  Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).  We may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools. --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThese are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - <NAME/> has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in <NAME/> that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National <NAME/> League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in <NAME/> for interviews!  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7901
aV\u000a\u000aSince you are the lead, I assume that you have an idea from <NAME/> on what he is looking for.  Since <NAME/> referenced ENW, I assume that we will include roles with regard to IT development projects.  Do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of Infrastructure roles as well?  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7902
aV\u000a\u000aI worlked with <NAME/> Gosset, <NAME/> White and <NAME/> Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  <NAME/> Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  \u000a\u000aI mentioned to <NAME/> that letters had been given to both <NAME/> Gossett and <NAME/> Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have <NAME/> covered, but with the change in <NAME/> Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  <NAME/> was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that <NAME/> Superty's name was submitted by <NAME/> <NAME/> for a promotion.  \u000a\u000aThanks.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPumpkin recipe dip attached.  \u000a\u000aAbsolutely - I would love for you to continue on the newsletter for next year.  Perhaps you would consider being the official Editor for next year?  That is the job that you are really doing!\u000a\u000a<NAME/> sent her application in to OU today.  It's one of four schools to which she will apply, so nothing definitive yet.  But it is nice to get one out the door!  --<NAME/> \u000a\u000aMy assistant is faxing the two pages regarding news from national.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for <NAME/> Luce and <NAME/> Y. to see if we can catch both in <NAME/> sometime next week.  <NAME/> Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:\u000a\u000aGas			<NAME/> Vickers (East)\u000a			<NAME/> Luce (Central)\u000a			<NAME/> Tycholiz (West)\u000a\u000aDerivatives		<NAME/> LaGrasta\u000a\u000aPower		<NAME/> Duran\u000a			Ozzie Pagan\u000a			<NAME/> Baughman\u000a			<NAME/> Shuckley \u000a\u000aPortland		<NAME/> Calger\u000a\u000aCalgary		Ladain\u000a\u000aMexico		<NAME/> Y. \u000a\u000aWhen you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and <NAME/>.  I also want to share this info with <NAME/> Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with <NAME/> Mrha and <NAME/> Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  \u000a\u000aDo you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7905
aV\u000a\u000aExactly!  Mom sent me the pictures from the hospital with <NAME/>.  I could easily be mistaken for her grandmother, I'm afraid.  I see pictures of myself and wonder who that older person is?!?  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7906
aV\u000a\u000aTalked with <NAME/> - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.  \u000a\u000aI looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.  Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew. Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.  \u000a\u000aHave sent e-mail notice of meeting - included <NAME/> Mends and <NAME/> <NAME/> since I don't know Paskin's whereabouts and I do know that <NAME/> Pickering won't be here.  Otherwise, <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be out of the loop.  Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?  \u000a\u000aI will also leave voice mail messages on everyone's <NAME/> extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.  Not sure that McConnell will meet with <NAME/> W.   <NAME/> will update me after the 3:00 meeting. \u000a\u000a--<NAME/>\u000a

p7909
aV\u000a\u000aCan you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ENA business?  I haven't seen it yet since we talked this morning.  <NAME/> Hall and I thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and <NAME/> on resignations.  SInce you have submitted that list, we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves.  \u000a\u000aSince I haven't received the list yet, please send it to both <NAME/> Hall and me.  I will be out of the office on Thursday, so <NAME/> will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow.  \u000a\u000aThanks.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSorry - I read the first e-mail before seeing this one.  Thanks for not asking me where my head was when we talked!! --<NAME/>\u000a
p7911
aV\u000a\u000aI printed copies of this resume the day that I received it from you.  I met with <NAME/> Perlman that day and gave her the resume in person.  I also called Philippe Bibi and sent him a copy of the resume.  I am also by way of this e:mail message going to copy <NAME/> Jones on this resume.  <NAME/> heads up HR for <NAME/> Net Works.  Feel free to give <NAME/>, Philippe and <NAME/> a call to add your personal comments about the candidate.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSorry that we didn't get together today.  I plan to be out of the office from now until  Monday, December 31.  I will be in <NAME/> through Christmas, and can be available by cell phone on Thursday and Friday this week, December 20 and 21.  I will be in New York for several days following Christmas, from December 26 through December 28.  \u000a\u000aTomorrow, I will send you a contact list for Mid and Back Office Operations for the remainder of this week and the week of Christmas.  That contact list contains my hotel number in New York, if something critical were to arise while I am out of the office.  \u000a\u000aI had provided you yesterday with a list of IT and Operations personnel to be included in the meeting to be set with <NAME/> Saeger regarding the process for handling terminations of transactions and arriving at the residual value of deals non-terminated deals in the risk books.  I have not seen a meeting scheduled yet, and as you can see from the memo that I sent you yesterday, many risk book administrators will begin their vacations around Christmas this week.  If you still plan to hold the meeting this week, please notify my assistant, <NAME/> Valdez (x39106) and I will try to join in by phone.  \u000a\u000aI hope that you and your family have a great Christmas.  I will see you back in the office on December 31. Feel free to call me in the interim either at home or on my cell phone.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aJune 12 works well for me.  It is likely that we will be on vacation on Friday, June 22.  My husband is finalizing airline reservations today, and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on Friday, June 22 rather than Saturday, June 23.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI was at the pre-seasoner opener at <NAME/> Field last Friday night and saw you throw the first pitch.  It was a nice one - never a chance of it hitting the dirt!  -<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am forwarding this message to you sent to me by <NAME/> Superty.  <NAME/> is the director of Gas Logistics for <NAME/> Americas, and attended the lunch meeting that I held yesterday.  I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale.  I can always count on <NAME/> to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request.  Here are his ideas.  Some of these I can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader <NAME/> Net Works employee base.  Some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees.  I would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an <NAME/>-wide basis is you think that would be appropriate.  I could certainly use some help, however.  \u000a\u000aYou may already have a venue for this, but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals (like <NAME/> Superty) who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale.  Not a formalized committee, and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized.  Just an ad hoc group to make a difference now.  Maybe this doesn't have to be corporate wide.  Maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group, if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit, and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas.  This might be even more effective with buy-in and initiative from the business units, rather than the feel of a corporate overlay.  As I am typing, I am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in <NAME/> Net Works and simply share what we are doing with others.  \u000a\u000aYour thoughts?  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.   We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.  The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning).  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon. He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have.  We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite".   \u000a\u000aThere is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day.  The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend.  \u000a\u000a--<NAME/>\u000a

This is our third year to work jointly with many of you in the business school to award these scholarships to outstanding students in their second year of the MBA program.

aV\u000a\u000aI will mail the checks and money to <NAME/>.  There was one other item that I was going to deliver to you.  One of the women who had prepared snacks for the last general meeting turnedin the recipe for her pumpkin dip.  She said that many people were asking her for it, and if we had room, maybe we could publish it in the newsletter.  I told her that we would have to see how much official material we have from the chapter and if we wind up with a needed "filler".  Let me know if you do need a filler, and I can send the recipe via an attachment.  Feel free to call me at work - 713-853-5926.  I have the recipe in my briefcase. \u000a \u000aGlad <NAME/> got back to you on the food drive - or lack there of!\u000a \u000aAt fall regional training, I attended a Communications session - they provided a list by month of desired national information (from the national website) to be included in our newsletters.

aV\u000a\u000aDo you want to have <NAME/> Rub join us for this budget meeting to review IT Infrastructure costs?  She owns that piece of the ENW budget.  Let me know.

aV\u000a\u000aI left individual voice mail messages for <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/> tonight, thanking them for spending part of their Saturday in the office.  I appreciate your personal organization and leadership of the team so that the DPR could be completed Saturday morning and delivered to RAC for their further analysis over the weekend.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  It's after 5:00 today and apparently the break out by project for ENW IT Development Capital is still outstanding from <NAME/>.  Although we have missed our commitment to get restated (and fully footing) info back to <NAME/> Leff and <NAME/> Stubblefield today, I think that we need to be able to follow through on this tomorrow.  This is just one of a number of budget meetings that we are having to prepare for as Net Works, and it would be great to get one of these packages finished.   \u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  Can <NAME/> get this wrapped up today so that we can finalize all of this tomorrow.  We will just move today's plans -restated pages to you, <NAME/> Apollo,  and <NAME/> by noon and, with your sign off, distribution of revised packet by afternoon - to Thursday.

aV\u000a\u000aFYI - response after my call to <NAME/>.  Agreement refers to employees of <NAME/> Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas specifically.  <NAME/> Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from <NAME/> Networks.  Close date on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from that point.  --<NAME/>\u000a

Thanks. \u000a\u000aPlease go through my e-mails and print everything from <NAME/> Becker, put it in a folder (all should relate to follow up on the Accounting offsite in Galveston) for me.  I need to review that stuff and figure out when the next follow up meeting is going to be with either <NAME/> and/or <NAME/>.  They have asked me to chair one of the follow up issues.  Some of the e-mails from <NAME/> relate to volunteers for my team.  I think there is also one saved voice mail with a volunteer's name.  Can you create a list (with contact numbers) of all volunteers from e-mails and voice mails to date?  Thanks.  Then please delete all e-mails from <NAME/>.  \u000a\u000aAlso, please go through my e-mails and print everything that relates to Center for <NAME/>'s Future.  I need to review these.  Most is from <NAME/> Schoppe, but a few are from others, but reference CHF.  Then delete all of these e-mails.  \u000a\u000aE-mails from <NAME/> <NAME/> regarding recruiting.  Please print all so that I can review them.  Please delete all e-mails after printing.  Thanks.  \u000a\u000aThis effort plus my clean up today should help shrink the e-mails that remain.

aV\u000a\u000aThere are 3 excellent players whom I would draft onto any team that have not been picked up on the Netco list.  \u000a\u000aTwo of the three are <NAME/> Hall and <NAME/> Sweeney - details below in my e-mail to <NAME/>.  \u000a\u000aAnother excellent player is Shona <NAME/>.  She currently leads the group that produces the DPR and the MPR.  She had excellent experience with PWC before joining <NAME/>, auditing trading companies in Europe.  I have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business.  She could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity.  \u000a\u000aI am not sure about the extent of your involvement with the creation of Netco.  If you do anticipate being involved, I would like to talk with you about these individuals and the roles that they could play in creating the best team for Netco.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPlease schedule a meeting for Thurday afternoon (30 minutes) with <NAME/> DeVille, Kerry Roper, <NAME/> Piper and me to review the operating budgets for 2002, and the impact on the ENW operating budget.  Thanks.\u000a
p7939
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is the memo that <NAME/> delivered to you/<NAME/> on  Tuesday.  One update is that <NAME/> Mills is now out of the office through Christmas.  <NAME/> Albrecht would be the appropriate risk rep in <NAME/>'s place is a meeting were to be held this week.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7940
aV\u000a\u000aSorry to hear about your grandmother.  Funerals, oddly enough, seem to create opportunities to catch up with other family members.  Nice to see everyone, you are just sorry about the catalyst for bringing you together.  I will talk with you soon.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7941
aV\u000a\u000aPlease see exchange below.  Can you send me current plans - who, when, where and what - for London reviews?  I would put a several day moratorium on contacting London regarding upcoming Doorstep review plans until I get back with you.  Thanks.  --<NAME/> \u000a\u000aI know that in our meeting with <NAME/> and <NAME/> we talked about being creative on London reviews and leveraging what is being done by EAS - maybe directing them on additional activities and doing some leg work by video conference.  What happened to that effort?  Sounds as if from the London e-mails that we stepped right back to flying people around the world.\u000a
p7942
aV\u000a\u000aYour champagne is under my desk.  I hope that you and <NAME/> will enjoy it!!   Have a wonderful holiday and I will see you on the 31st.\u000a
p7943
aV\u000a\u000aResume attached per my voice mail to you.  This guy is currently at Compaq, but wants to do something else.  Any interest?  As I said in my voice mail, I will be glad to call my friend <NAME/> Schempf to get more info on this guy if you would like.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7944
aV\u000a\u000aFYI - as we get closer to quarter end, it may help your DPR team to know about any pending deals that could be done close to quarter end.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7945
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your note.  I am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear!  Let's hope for reveral of last year's score.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> that 2nd year is going well.  I will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with <NAME/> May and the <NAME/> scholarship winners later in October.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7946
aV\u000a\u000aDoes any of this make sense to the two of you?  Please get back with me pon January 3rd and let me know if we do have outstanding issues with AEP and if we have unfinished projects from <NAME/> Guilley.  Thanks. --<NAME/>\u000a
p7947
aV\u000a\u000aHere is agenda for Causey's offsite next week.  I told <NAME/> that you would be in town and she said that you (and <NAME/>) would certainly be welcome for all or part of the day.  FYI - the location for this meeting is at the Adams <NAME/> Hotel.  This is not very close to downtown - would require a car or cab.  I would be glad to have you ride with me -- just let me know which things you would like to attend.  My thoughts are that I will not attend for the entire day - through lunch looks like a good point at which to break and head back to the office.  Let me know what you want to do so that we can schedule meetings around your choices for Wednesday.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7948
aV\u000a\u000aThat would be great if you have time.  If you run out of time, we can wing it in lavendar.  Thanks.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7949
aV\u000a\u000aI know you are both busy.  Lots of push back from London on Doorstep Reviews.  I recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now.  However, it is London's normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing.  I think that they view being a subject of a Doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part.  \u000a\u000aNext week I will follow up with you to get your thoughts on Doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter.  Wanted you to see my reply to Fernley below.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7950
aV\u000a\u000aWhat is lily of the valley?  I don't know.  Would it add anything special to the coursage?  If so, I would be glad to spring for it.  I just don't know enough about flowers to make an educated call.  Could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for $60?  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/> often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, anyway.  \u000a\u000aYou know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in full force for later life -- only kidding!) --<NAME/>\u000a
p7951
aV\u000a\u000aEmployees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly.  We want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing <NAME/>'s business.  HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.  \u000a\u000aThe year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.  That process is slated for February, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that.  \u000a\u000aI am happy to answer your questions.  Feel free to send me others as the come up.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Apollo has recently joined the team and <NAME/> Herod has recently married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of <NAME/>'s arrival and <NAME/>'s marriage, I hope that you can join <NAME/> and me for drinks and appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for you.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Solmonson, one of my direct reports, has been out of the office since March 1, 2001 and it is not readily known when she will return to work.  All business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following tasks:\u000a\u000a1)  <NAME/> the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming e-mails directed to <NAME/> Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete this review?\u000a\u000a2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for <NAME/>'s e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being forwarded to <NAME/> Schulte for response."\u000a\u000a3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to <NAME/> Schulte's mail box. \u000a\u000a  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> is out with the flu and may be out through tomorrow.  I will coordinate with him on org charts.  Where do you want to have Gas Logistics - under <NAME/> in operations or under trading?  Given your answer, we just need to be consistent with commercial on this for the org charts.  \u000a\u000aAlso, I talked with <NAME/> Hall today and would expect to hear definitively from him tomorrow regarding his commitment to Netco.  I had an interesting conversation with <NAME/> Pearce this morning, and sounds as if you already have an alternative plan under way.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7955
aV\u000a\u000aI will be in the office the whole week of April 9.  I will ask my assistant to call yours to set up a 30 minute meeting for us next week to discuss the candidates that we saw during the scholarship interviews.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7956
aV\u000a\u000aThere is another Senior Director in London in Operations - <NAME/> McAndrew.  She was just joined <NAME/> in April, and I was unsure of her title.  Confirmed that this morning.\u000a
p7957
aV\u000a\u000aThrough Friday, October 12 at 5:00 pm I will be in ECN 2748.  I will move to ECS over the weekend, so if you do not get my packet to me before 5:00 on Friday, please call my assistant (<NAME/> Valdez x39106) to get my new location for Monday.\u000a
p7958
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.  \u000a\u000aMost Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.  \u000a\u000aWhat would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7959
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from <NAME/>.  It is with regret that I have accepted <NAME/>'s letter of recommendation.  <NAME/> has contributed greatly during her tenure at <NAME/>, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate <NAME/>'s personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing <NAME/> well. \u000a\u000aAlso effective April 16, we have made a realignment within <NAME/> Net Works of the group led by <NAME/> <NAME/>.  <NAME/> will now report directly to <NAME/> Zipper, who leads <NAME/>Online.  The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to <NAME/>Online a smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between <NAME/>Online and our legacy systems.  The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  operations of <NAME/>Online.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have <NAME/>'s team as an integral part of the larger <NAME/>Online team.  <NAME/>'s team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I met with <NAME/>'s team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.  <NAME/> has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  <NAME/> is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in <NAME/>'s e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with <NAME/> and her team.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your call a few weeks back.  Has been totally crazy here, with incredibly long hours over the last 6 to 8 weeks.  Today is my last day in the office until Monday, December 31.   I need the break!  Has been hard to squeeze in time to get ready for Christmas.  And we are hosting Tyler's 4th birthday party on Friday this week.  Christmas at home, as usual, and the <NAME/> and I will be off to New York the morning of December 26th with her friend <NAME/> and her mom.  We thought it would be a fun trip with our seniors!  Shopping, eating and seeing plays - will be back on the night of the 28th.  \u000a\u000aOur upcoming trips are to <NAME/> for four days in early March with the high school drill team for nationals competition. Then spring break in mid-March in Telluride for our first family ski trip!  Hopefully we will all come back in one piece!\u000a\u000aHave a wonderful Christmas and enjoy the sun in San <NAME/>.  Christmas cards are coming - you may just receive yours after Christmas.  Mo is in town and will join us for dinner tomorrow night. Grapevine has it that she is skinny as a rail!  \u000a\u000aCollege update:  <NAME/> got her applications in to UT, OU, SMU and TCU before November 1.  She has acceptance letters from OU and SMU in hand, and is waiting to hear from UT and TCU.  I have no idea what her decision will be!  \u000a\u000aOur best to <NAME/> and the girls.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe are looking forward to dinner with you and other faculty members on Tuesday, October 16 as we honor the three students who are the recipients of the 2001-2002 <NAME/> MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  We have booked The <NAME/> House once again.  \u000a\u000aI wanted to confirm several details with you.  \u000a\u000a1)  Cocktails at 7:00 pm; Dinner at 7:30 pm  --Do these times work for you?  \u000a\u000a2)  Last year's invitees from UT included the following:\u000a    Associate <NAME/> <NAME/> Zerrillo				philip.zerrillo@bus.utexas.edu\u000a    Assistant <NAME/> Britt Freund				brittf@mail.utexas.edu\u000a    Dr. Ehud Ronn					eronn@mail.utexas.edu\u000a    Dr. <NAME/> Gau					ggau@mail.utexas.edu\u000a    Dr. <NAME/> Hadaway					hadawayb@mail.utexas.edu\u000a    Dr. <NAME/> Golden					mkllg@mail.utexas.edu\u000a    Mr. <NAME/> Garcia					eloy.garcia@bus.utexas.edu\u000a\u000a	Would you like to make any changes or additions to this list for the dinner?  If so, please let me know the changes and appropriate e-mail addresses as necessary.  \u000a\u000aI will update you later in the week with the list of <NAME/> attendees and the names of the students and their spouses, as applicable.  \u000a\u000aI look forward to seeing you again at the dinner.  I have enjoyed being involved in the interview process for selecting the scholarship recipients for the last three years, and I especially appreciate the opportunity for <NAME/> and the University to jointly recognize these deserving students.  Please call me with any questions regarding the dinner.\u000a
p7962
aV\u000a\u000aI talked with <NAME/> Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  <NAME/> believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to <NAME/>, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, <NAME/> envisions simply e:mails or memos between <NAME/> and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between <NAME/> and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from <NAME/> Ball (<NAME/>) to <NAME/> <NAME/> (AEP).  \u000a\u000aOnly critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  <NAME/> Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with <NAME/>'s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with <NAME/> Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and <NAME/> Koehler is sending it to <NAME/> Perkins in <NAME/>'s Treasury group for her review.  Upon <NAME/>'s review, <NAME/> will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  \u000a\u000aWe devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by <NAME/> will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the <NAME/> and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by <NAME/> Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  \u000a\u000aI understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: \u000a\u000a	1)  <NAME/> and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that <NAME/> has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or \u000a\u000a	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  \u000a\u000aPlease let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.\u000a
p7963
aV\u000a\u000aI have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever.  I have coordinated with <NAME/> Hall this morning and he will attend the 10:00 meeting in ECN 30C1.  He will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have.  All that I could do at this point is cough and nod! \u000a \u000aI could certainly answer any questions for the Euros via e-mail, if needed, over the weekend.  Call me at home (281-370-8568) and I will be glad to do so.  \u000a \u000aI do expect to be in the office on Monday - hopefully with a voice.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7964
aV\u000a\u000aHave updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.  \u000a\u000aTHESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: \u000a\u000a\u000aHad Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.  Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for <NAME/>'s EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.  You will want to gut check this with <NAME/>. \u000a\u000aHad <NAME/>'s current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.  Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.  Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.  You will need to get that detail from <NAME/> to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.  \u000a\u000aThere was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.  Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).  His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.  But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.  Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.  Please go over details with <NAME/> and make corrections as needed.  \u000a\u000aDidn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.  Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.   <NAME/> only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.  So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.  Please review with <NAME/> and make corrections as needed.  \u000a\u000a \u000aHave a nice Thanksgiving with your families.  You can reach my by cell phone tommorrow (mine: 713-417-1591 or <NAME/>'s:  713-299-1436) or at my parents' home starting about mid-afternoon (512-458-5510).  We will drive back from <NAME/> sometime on Friday.  Could come in on Saturday or Sunday, as needed.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7965
aV\u000a\u000aSorry those didn't get to you yesterday.  It was 7:00 pm before I had time to get that together for you, only to discover that all that I had were hard copies.  Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  \u000a\u000aLet me know how the meeting with <NAME/> and <NAME/> went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with <NAME/> Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.  \u000a\u000aHow are your 5:00 pm meetings?  \u000a\u000aI will catch up tomorrow.  --<NAME/> \u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/> that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!!\u000a
p7966
aV\u000a\u000aYes, this was to be the review with Corp. - Lay, Whalley and Frevert.  I am working with <NAME/> LIndsey on the revised schedule - still don't have one, but I will let you know as soon as I know something.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7967
aV\u000a\u000aAttached is list of questions.  How soon could we have answers to these?  I would appreciate any help that you could give me on this.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7968
aV\u000a\u000aYour recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National <NAME/> League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. \u000a\u000aWe have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.\u000a
p7969
aV\u000a\u000aSounds good.  I can be flexible - I will let <NAME/> know to expect a call from your assistant on this.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7970
aV\u000a\u000aThe list of proposed Netco employees that <NAME/> Fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for Weather and Crude.  Do you contemplate that Netco would trade those commodities/products?  <NAME/> Hall's team that he has assembled for Netco does not include anyone with either Weather or Crude operations experience.  \u000a\u000aWe retained two top-notch operations individuals - <NAME/> Hall and <NAME/> Sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for Netco.  Both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation, risk books and settlements.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for Weather.  Prior to has role in EGM, <NAME/> created the MPR and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio.  He also has had extensive experience in gas risk management.   \u000a\u000aSweeney's most recent assignment has been to manage operations for EIM.  The bulk of his <NAME/> experience has been in crude and crude products.  He was part of the original team that opened the Singapore trading office and has experience in the UK as well.  \u000a\u000aIf you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power, <NAME/> and <NAME/> would both be great players to have on the Netco team.  \u000a\u000aLet's discuss.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7971
aV\u000a\u000aThis is the memo crafted by <NAME/> Parsons that was sent to the traders last week regarding their back-up spots on the 30th floor of ECN during the remainder of the construction in ECS.  You and <NAME/> were copied on the original send of this memo.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7972
aV\u000a\u000aThis date change means that I won't be able to make it to the open house.  I will be out of town on April 27.\u000a
p7973
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I know that we would like to get together with you to discuss UT recruiting.  The easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work.  My assistant is <NAME/> Thompson (x39106) and <NAME/>'s assistant is <NAME/> Westbrook.   By copy of this note, I will ask  <NAME/> to coordinate with <NAME/> and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that <NAME/> and I could get with you.  -<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMcKinsey:  I read their letter - pretty good recap of where we are today.  <NAME/> Busby and I would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal trade-offs relative to that.  Would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with McKinsey.  What I know is that McKinsey can be very expensive to work with.  We would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with McKinsey.  \u000a\u000a\u000aStaff Meeting Attendees:  <NAME/> <NAME/> Sommers now attend the Thursday Net Works staff meeting?  Does he know about it for this week?  Have we made any decisions on the purpose and make-up of that meeting?  We are including <NAME/>'s directs on IT, but not their counter parts in Operations.  Including operations would make that meeting too big, so I am not necessarily suggesting that.  Just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have.  (FYI - In Causey's staff meeting today, <NAME/> mentioned that the move of the ISC under Net Works was announced within Net Works - and spread - before Causey or <NAME/> announced this to the people in the ISC.  Creates a bit of a bumpy start.  Causey is still very much in favor of this move - he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired,.  I can share those with you.  Causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with <NAME/> in agreeing to the transition.)  \u000a\u000aBudgets:  After meeting with Whalley last week, should we consider coming to the table as Net Works with a reduction in budgeted dollars (expense and capital) of 10% or so?  That has not been our goal to date, but maybe it should be, given the stretch that <NAME/> is trying to make.  Might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves.  I have some ideas on how we might get there.  Let me know - we would need to get that done this week.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> responded and filled me in on the issue.  Sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems.  How are we going to clean up the existing backlog?  Did you know that this had grown so large?  <NAME/> says that this sits in <NAME/> Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by <NAME/>.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.  (<NAME/>'t worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we can manage this better.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Center for <NAME/>'s Future.  I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the Forum.  I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting, talented members of the <NAME/> community.  I know that I will enjoy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well as collaborating on some "homework" assignments that we will complete between now and then.   I especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on <NAME/>'s future through developing both relationships and action steps  through my association with the Center.   Thanks again for making this opportunity available to me.  --<NAME/> Beck\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAbsolutely, we would enjoy having <NAME/> <NAME/> join us for dinner.  I am glad that you made the suggestion.  Please extend the invitation to her now so that she can reserve the date on her calendar, and if you will send me her e-mail address we will send her an invitation as well.  \u000a\u000aThanks for the congratulations.  Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.  \u000a\u000aI look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.  --<NAME/>\u000a

The group description may be the most difficult to get, but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within ENW and what they do.  I will be glad to help you with the details - just let me know.   Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization.  \u000a\u000aI would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning.  Thanks.  \u000a\u000a--<NAME/> \u000a\u000aCan I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings?  The list that I used last week for Senior Directors and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.  I just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.  Thanks.\u000a
p7983
aV\u000a\u000aYou are welcome to attend any of these.  In fact, it is helpful for cross calibration purposes if there is some cross over in the meetings.  Do get with <NAME/> and <NAME/> before the meetings to give them ffeedback on those book administrators who are problematic.  \u000a\u000aPATTI:  Please add <NAME/> to the attendee list for the Risk and Settlements PRC meetings.

aV\u000a\u000aIn the lunch meeting that I held yesterday, I asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on ways to improve employee morale at present.  I can always count on <NAME/> Superty to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request - and to act!  Here are his ideas.  My thought is to get together an informal team (doesn't even have to be announced or publicized) to continue to generate ideas that could make a difference to employee morale right now and to make some of these things happen.  Any thoughts?  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a1)  Did you add to the numbers that <NAME/> and I reviewed with you on Sunday?  You had mentioned folding in some analysts and associates - did you do that?  UBS was asking me about numbers today, and I wanted to be consistent with the answers. \u000a\u000a2)  What about Calgary?  You were going to ask <NAME/> M. to have <NAME/> Hedstrom coordinate over the weekend.  Didn't hear from her.  Are you handling this through <NAME/>?  Or do you want me to include Calgary operations in the final org chart for Netco Operations?  --<NAME/>\u000a

I have, however, given has resume to <NAME/> Gros who has been leading CommodityLogic and is also paired with <NAME/> Perlman and me on evaluating the potential for commercializing our mid and back office services.  In this effort, it is likely that <NAME/> will to put together a marketing team.  I suggested that he consider <NAME/> for one of those positions.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMy hot buttons for operations  would be recruiting, career development and resource planning.  Before I simply make assignments, let me canvas my direct reports to be certain that we are assigning those with passion around these areas.  My staff meeting will be tomorrow at 9:00.  I will get back with you on volunteers and also to either reaffirm or alter the hot buttons that I mentioned.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI would like to have my directors and senior directors take this course.  There is just one course date noted in the attachment in May.  <NAME/> there be other dates during the year?  I can't have everyone go at the same time.  I would like to get the list of dates in 2001 and then send a memo to directors and senior directors requiring them to attend one of the sessions.  Can you also get me a list of the director and senior directors that I have in EIM, EGM and EA?  <NAME/> this course also be offered in London for directors?  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGlad that the two of you could make the trip to <NAME/> this week.  Hopefully, your the time spent here was worthwhile in terms of sharing ideas and further developing contacts.  I <NAME/>, I will look forward to continue dialoge as we explore commercialization opportunities.  <NAME/>, I will get back with you next week on potential dates for the annual global risk management operations offsite (late Oct) and on likely dates for my next trip to London. \u000a\u000aI enjoyed the shopping and dinner.  --<NAME/>\u000a
p7994
aV\u000a\u000aIt didn't occur to me until seeing <NAME/>'s message that we might have a hole in communications with <NAME/> being out on an extended basis.  We should probably create a message on <NAME/>'s phone that refers callers to someone else - ditto on e:mail messages.  <NAME/>, does it make sense for that referral to be <NAME/>, or you, or <NAME/>?  Others within our organization that may try to reach <NAME/> could have questions about global databases, projects that <NAME/>'s group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you don't think it is appropriate - but <NAME/> and/or <NAME/> came to mind as possible contacts.  By copy to <NAME/>, I also wonder if we should review incoming e:mails that have come to <NAME/> over the last several weeks to see if there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know what you think.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aBig ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus <NAME/> Piper and <NAME/> Petruska.  I am missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not missing a page, please ask <NAME/> to include the complete list of attendees (all who were at the ASE plus <NAME/> and <NAME/>).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDoes <NAME/> know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that <NAME/> was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it with <NAME/> Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for others.  --<NAME/>\u000a

Just FYI.  \u000a\u000aI met with <NAME/> Castleman yesterday to get a feel for the areas where McMahon has questions regarding our Net Works budget.  I will pass those along to <NAME/>, <NAME/>, and <NAME/> today, and will copy you two on that note.  Bowen has already reviewed <NAME/> Sweeney's budget for Operations.  <NAME/> reduced his direct costs by $1MM relative to the original budget submitted, and <NAME/> says that <NAME/> and <NAME/> are fine with that one now.  I don't anticipate much conversation around that on Monday.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected\u000aFROM: <NAME/> Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations\u000a\u000aLast fall, the <NAME/> Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from <NAME/> Skilling.  All wholesale companies (<NAME/> Americas, <NAME/> Europe, <NAME/> Global Markets and <NAME/> Industrial Markets) plus <NAME/> Net Works and <NAME/> Global Assets were included in the <NAME/> Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into <NAME/> Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to <NAME/> wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.\u000a\u000aSince this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under <NAME/> Net Works.  Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to <NAME/> Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.  \u000a\u000aTo correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to <NAME/> Price and <NAME/> Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.\u000a\u000aThere are some direct effects that surround the conversion to <NAME/> Net Works. Because you are transferring between <NAME/> payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.\u000a\u000aThe excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with any questions.  \u000a\u000aWe will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:  \u000a\u000aBusiness Unit	HR Contact	Phone#\u000aEGM 	<NAME/> Hill	713/853-4218\u000aEIM	<NAME/> <NAME/>	713/345-7803\u000aEA/Global Services	<NAME/> De <NAME/>	713/345-3662\u000aEA/Global Services	<NAME/> McLoughlin	713/853-6703\u000a\u000aThanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of <NAME/> Wholesale Services.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSorry to cut the conversation short last night, but frankly I was in tears and it didn't make sense to continue the conversation.  Certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel, you should do what you think is best for you.  We will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you.   My reaction last night was simply shock, because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit.  And your lead in to the conversation with "you know we are staying at a hotel...", was such a surprise.  Yes, you stayed at a hotel when you were here for Thanksgiving, but that was with <NAME/>, <NAME/>, Brigeda, <NAME/> and <NAME/> staying in our home as well.  With just the two of you, and since you had said nothing to the contrary, I assumed that you would be in our home.  \u000a\u000aWhat you couldn't know, of course, is the caring time that I have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room, all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend.  But it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel.  I had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet, a real bed instead of just a frame, I ironed sheets on Sunday night (something that I never do for us!) and have my framer on a tight turn-around on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room.  Certainly other guests can enjoy these things, too, but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit. \u000a\u000aI have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel, and again, whatever is best for you.  Sounds as if we should make that the "norm" from this point forward, and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone.  \u000a\u000aI do hope that you can come in time for lunch on Friday.  I am planning to take the day off from work, and the plan was that <NAME/> would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at Champions.  <NAME/> has taken some office space near Champions, and we had planned to show you that as well.  Then we can rest (you can to do that at the hotel, if that is better for you), before having our nails done at 4:00.  But again, whatever works best for you.  Just let us know.  --<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI think that your Phibro card is from our original meeting in New York, a lifetime or two ago!!  \u000a\u000aSounds as if your rollercoaster experience with <NAME/> was perhaps a preview of the subsequent weeks at <NAME/>.  Thank goodness for those little guys to go home to every night.  \u000a\u000aMy little guys aren't so little any more.  <NAME/> is a senior this year - had all of her college applications submitted by November 1, and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done.  She has gotten one acceptance - University of Oklahoma.  She also applied to UT, SMU and TCU and is waiting to hear from them.  She may hear from SMU and TCU before Christmas - UT probably after the first of the year.  (By the way, <NAME/> and I are strongly talking up the state school thing, given the current <NAME/> share price, or diminished portion thereof.)  This senior year is going by all too quickly, especially since the last month or so I seem to be hearing about it second-hand having spent way too many hours in the <NAME/> Building.\u000a\u000aAnd mentioning the building, I moved to <NAME/> Center South (the new building) in mid September.  I'm on the 4th floor - one of the trading floors.  Kinneman is on this floor, too.  Kind of a cool building, but weird because it is not really finished.  Our floor is fine, but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator - and some elevators are "panelled" with rough plywood inside.   The sky ring thing is cool, too, but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space.  We walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down.  Not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate, but we are here!  \u000a\u000aDo let me know if you are going to be in <NAME/> anytime soon.  I would love to get together with you.  Between 9/11 and our current cash constraints,  my previously planned November London visit is not happening!  \u000a\u000aEnjoy your Thanksgiving in London.  --<NAME/>\u000a

If so, that is not good.\u000a\u000aYou mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me previously.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThis spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply & demand in San <NAME/> by unit.  Next, I want to look at the numbers by bedroom.  Let's compare numbers.\u000a\u000aHere is a list of questions:\u000a\u000a1.	Unit mixes of all proposed projects.\u000a2.	Completion date of  Blazer Development (220), Capstone (270), Melrose (202), Bonner-Carr. (186)\u000a3.	Is the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000aThis spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI noticed in the san macos record that some zoning changes were underway.  First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for "seniors".  I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I have mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aHere is the article:\u000a\u000aSector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  Home and landowners in northwestern San <NAME/> will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San <NAME/> City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident <NAME/> Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to "community commercial" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan.  However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director <NAME/> Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member <NAME/> Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.  "I'd rather say "no' and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then," Hughson said.  Councilman <NAME/> Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut.  "It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there," Mihalkanin said.  A motion by Hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from RR 12 into the property failed on a 3-3 tie vote with San <NAME/> Mayor <NAME/> Chiu and council members Joe Cox and <NAME/> Mayhew voting against the move. Council member <NAME/> Castex <NAME/> was not present at the meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise.  Oak Heights resident <NAME/> McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole.  "This is not a victory for one side or the other," said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford's initial plans for his property, "but a victory for the City of San <NAME/>. We started out with all R-1...we've come a long way."\u000a

The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on.  $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI.  I spoke to <NAME/> Murnane this afternoon.

aV\u000a\u000a10:30 (Dow Jones) The key to analyzing media stocks is....automobiles? Yes, it's true, suggest SG Cowen media analysts <NAME/> Hatch, <NAME/> Mirsky and <NAME/> Handler, in this week's Media Money Manager. Automobile advertising is the largest category in domestic consumer media spending and accounts for about 17%, or $15 billion, the stock studiers say, using data from Competitive Media Reporting. By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies "to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports." Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time <NAME/> (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp. (NWS), and Disney (DIS). ( BS)\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI read through the data request.  We cannot provide several of the items that they requested.  We do not break out our california deals into separate transport and commodity components.  Also the majortiy of our buys and sells net out without exchanging actual transport contract numbers.  I know in the past <NAME/> C. has worked with our back office to pull the data directly from the system.  Let me know if I need to do anything to assist gathering the data.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aManaging VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.\u000a\u000aI still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  \u000a\u000aI realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.\u000a\u000aPlease consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aThe release that <NAME/> prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that I have been paying since 4/20.  You might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the $11,000.  It might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 4/20.\u000a\u000aAlso May 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes.  But I have not received payment on either.\u000a\u000aLet's try and wrap this up this week.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8096
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aDid you get a chance to look at the release?  Drop me a note when you can.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI plugged the data on Colonial Oaks into your format.  The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  \u000a\u000aThe asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  \u000a\u000aThe numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  <NAME/> Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.\u000a\u000aFinancing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?\u000a\u000aI will follow up with a phone call.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ajacques,\u000a\u000aI have attached a summary of the utilities I paid since the 4/20 closing.  The total is $7,328.87.  Do you need to incorporate this number is the release  or can I just net this amount against the $11,000 and pay them the difference.  Do they have an executable copy of the release?  I would like to settle up on the repairs, utilities, and the release now.  I don't want these issues to get bogged down with the 1st lienholders approval of any assignments.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

The cash to be escrowed is approx. $650K.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI sent a copy of an article discussing oil and gas stocks.  The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to <NAME/> and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.\u000a\u000aOn a different note, <NAME/> is at T Bar M camp this week.  <NAME/> is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot <NAME/>.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>'s house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.\u000aWe should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSince the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.\u000a\u000aCan you help us with these questions?  <NAME/> this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aReagan,\u000a\u000aJust wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8113
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI sent you a fax of <NAME/> Kolb's comments on the release.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aFor clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  \u000a\u000aYour response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states "Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of "a single sum distribution" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to <NAME/> W. or <NAME/> L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> <NAME/> share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8115
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aTwo items:\u000a\u000a1.  I spoke to <NAME/> McKay about Sumas.  His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40\u000a	His winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.\u000a	In conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about <NAME/> G's issues.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.\u000a\u000aI realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built.\u000a\u000aPlease email your cost estimates when complete.\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI would modify this document slightly.  The first section is titled "Introduction to Risk Management" and the second section is "Hedging Instruments/Risk Management Products".  However, many of the bullet points in the first section are describing hedging instruments that belong in second section.  I would limit the introduction to types of risk, identifying risk, and examples when risks are not hedged.  Then the second section should contain all the details of hedging tools.  Definitions of derivatives and how they can be used to manage the risk in the first section would be in this section.  The third section would include the roles and accounting basics.  You might want to include the commodity 101 info here, at least gas and power.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.\u000a\u000aOn another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some additional insight?\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I hope you can make her understand that I have not been obligated to keep these in my name for some time.  Since my attorney is out of town until Monday and I doubt that she has all the documents in place to actually place the property in a limited partnership (certainly not the 1st lienholders consent) we will have to work together next week.  \u000a\u000aIf you want to modify this letter let me know.

Maybe the attorneys can work this out faster than we have.  \u000a\u000aI spoke to the city this morning and the final bills are to be mailed out today.  So I should have an amount on Wednesday.  I will email and fax the amount and the supporting bills as soon as possible.  Maybe we can close out the release this week and consent to the assignment pending 1st lien holder approval.\u000a\u000aI have a favor to ask you.  I received the check from <NAME/> that was due May 20th.  However, I have misplaced it.  Can you ask her to put a stop on her 1st check and send me another (net of any costs for the stop payment).   If you would prefer for me to call her myself, I will.  It seems that communicating through you is working well. \u000a\u000aThanks for all your help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI need help determining how much margin the short options require.  My account has a value of around $1,400,000.  That includes 750,000 of us treasury notes.  I am ready to build a bond ladder of muni's.  I need to know how much I can purchase with the funds in this account.

aV\u000a\u000ajeff,\u000a\u000aIs the problem that the energy DWR purchased is above market and not needed by CORE  or  just above market.  If the energy is needed by CORE wouldn't the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and QF supply?  If the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time.  Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI checked with Wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels Wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included.  So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  \u000a\u000aCost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  \u000a\u000aThank you for your help.\u000a

In addition, Husband 1.0\u000auninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed\u000aundesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.\u000a\u000aConversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes\u000athe system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to\u000ano avail. What can I do?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a> >---------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aDear Desperate,\u000a\u000aFirst, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,\u000awhile Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the\u000acommand <C:\u005c I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.\u000a\u000aHusband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and\u000aFlowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to\u000aGrumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad\u000aprogram that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.\u000a\u000aDO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend\u000aprogram. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.\u000a\u000aIn summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a\u000alimited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider\u000abuying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend\u000aHot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.\u000a\u000aGood luck.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAttached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.\u000a\u000aThe bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:\u000a\u000a1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.\u000a\u000a2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.\u000a\u000a3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you have any further questions.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort <NAME/> project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by <NAME/> Fairley, <NAME/> McMichael, <NAME/> Concannon, <NAME/> Breese, <NAME/> Boyt, and <NAME/> <NAME/>.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)\u000a\u000a1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  <NAME/>'s 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. <NAME/>'s 82MW.\u000a\u000a2)  <NAME/> will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By <NAME/>	Ft. <NAME/> Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	\u000aMay	22,300	0	22,300	0	\u000aJune	22,300	0	22,300	0	\u000aJuly	22,300	0	22,300	0	\u000aAugust	22,300	0	22,300	0	\u000aSeptember	22,300	0	22,300	0	\u000a\u000a\u000a  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.\u000a\u000a3)  Ft. <NAME/> will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.\u000a\u000a4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. <NAME/> is not dispatched, thus leaving <NAME/> with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)\u000a\u000a5)  Because Ft. <NAME/> will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for <NAME/>.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.\u000a\u000a6) <NAME/> will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. <NAME/> via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a	\u000a\u000a   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By <NAME/>	Ft. <NAME/> Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of <NAME/>)	Capacity From East Desk	\u000aOctober	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	\u000aNovember	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	\u000aDecember	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	\u000aJanuary	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	\u000aFebruary	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	\u000aMarch	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	\u000aApril	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	\u000a\u000a\u000aNOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.\u000a\u000a7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.\u000a

I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.

aV\u000a\u000aAs I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  \u000a\u000aThe only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. \u000a\u000aPlease let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTeam,\u000a\u000aWe now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  <NAME/> Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name "EOL_Product_Listen".\u000a\u000aIn order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called "Tibco Rendezvous Client"  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/"Install Tibco Rendezvous Client".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program "EOL Program Listen".\u000a\u000aThe program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search\u000a\u000aSheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the "Start" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.\u000a\u000aA word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.\u000a\u000aPlease let me know if you have any questions/comments.  I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.  Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.  I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!  <NAME/> Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.  A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.  I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.\u000a\u000aGlad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.  Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDale,\u000a\u000aThanks for the email.  I would be happy to pay the 50.00 fee one last time, however, given that this account will not be touched and no changes in the accounts holdings are allowed under Canadian tax law given my status, we need to find a way to either avoid this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else.  I would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where I should send the money for the outstanding balance.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relating to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I think it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved.  Below is a quick dialog that <NAME/> Johnston and I have had with respect to the cuts and what we can and can not do.\u000a\u000aThis seems to be blown way out of proportion by <NAME/> Heal and if there is anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I decided I would take a look at the Stampeder's stats before I dropped you the line.  It looks like things are getting a little better (other than turnovers).

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSo its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hitting on some waitress at Hooters.  Ahhhhh those were the days!   How are things going?  What's new in the world?  Things here seem to be running there course.  Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest "<NAME/> Fox" for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end.  Well I think <NAME/> might have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.  I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty <NAME/> has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat.  We seem to have run out of cash and can't pay the bills.  Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.  Its kind of got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.  I can stay where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of like sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is. Or, I can try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the problem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.  Hence the soul searching and dilemma.  Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note, see how things are going.  Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could be worse.\u000a\u000aI'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off.  And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.  I get in late Friday the 21st and head back to <NAME/> Sunday the 30th.  Maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.  Anyway I have to get back to work.  I hope all is well in Cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aVladi,\u000a\u000aI don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.  Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.\u000a\u000aI don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.\u000a\u000aI hope the vacation is going well.  Sorry to disturb you.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPeople down here are shocked!  One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.  All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there.   Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower.  He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing.  Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves.  As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country!  Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision.  Hopefully, some good things start happening to me.  So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war.  I figure things can only get better!\u000a\u000aI'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHello Everyone,\u000a\u000aIt is time to get started in our quest to figure out the N.E.  Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:\u000a\u000a1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (<NAME/>, Meredith, <NAME/> or <NAME/> could you please try to track down some of this info)\u000a\u000a2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(<NAME/>, Meredith, <NAME/> or <NAME/> could you please try to track down some of this info)\u000a\u000a3)	<NAME/> players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (<NAME/> and <NAME/> could you please gather this info)\u000a\u000a4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)\u000a\u000aPlease come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHelllllooooo Aunt,\u000a\u000aI'm on my way to <NAME/> tomorrow.  I've sold the <NAME/> cabinets, but not the TV cabinet. (Still working on it!)  Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.  I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.  I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.   I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSorry, for not saying good-bye when you left last night.  I thought you were at work on Thursday and I thought I would wish you well then.  So I guess, better late than never.  Have a good and safe trip!\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8363
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aGood to hear from you.  Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.  <NAME/> keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.  It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.  Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.  Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.  I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.  Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.\u000a\u000aAnyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.  I have gone to a couple of college football games.  I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.  Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.   I also went to the Grand Prix of <NAME/>.  That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.  The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.  The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.  Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.  Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.  You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.\u000a\u000aTrading has been hard.  I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.  But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light. \u000a\u000aI hope everything is going well for you.  Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.  Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.  Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8364
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t worry with the 11GJ's just as long as we have the proper volumes over here.  Also, leap years are observed in the gas business.

aV\u000a\u000aHeeelllloooo G Money,\u000a\u000aLong time no e-mail!....  Things here are starting to settle down a little.  I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.  I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.  Last week end I went to the <NAME/> Grand Prix.  <NAME/> Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy <NAME/>?????) didn't do to well.  Although, <NAME/> had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.  It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the "thick" of things.  The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.\u000a\u000aA couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.  It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in.  There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.  I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about  as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.  Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.\u000a\u000aThe apartment is starting to get organized.  It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.  I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.\u000a\u000aHow are things with you?  Are you guys getting out much these days?  Anything new and exciting going on in your life?\u000a\u000aI hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.  Have one for me!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHow's it going.   Things down here are actually very slow.  They (upper Management) are still trying to figure out what to do.  In the mean time no one is trading.  I sit around most of the day and play games.  I keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said.  The old hurry up and wait.   <NAME/>'s (my girlfriend) whole department got let go the other day.  She is still there until Christmas doing the clean-up but, come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job.  Things down here could not have gone worse for her. I feel real bad, because in a way I had a part in her moving, but there is nothing I can do about it now.\u000a\u000aAre you an unsecured <NAME/> creditor, as they agreed to pay for your school and now won't be able too?  How are thing there?  Are you liking school?\u000a\u000aI'm heading back to Calgary on the 21st, and I'll be up there until at least the 30th (maybe longer).  I'd love to grab a beer if you have time.  You can reach me at (403) 239-0299, or I'll be stopping in at the office.\u000a\u000aTake care and I hope to see you in cow town.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHello,\u000a\u000aI was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS.

p8395
aV\u000a\u000aHello,\u000a\u000aYour right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a change'n with my life.\u000a\u000aFirst I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where <NAME/> and I drove from West Palm Beach to <NAME/>.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't that bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You would have loved <NAME/>, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture, and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com.  Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from <NAME/> but the traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in <NAME/> (about 5.5 hrs) from New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do this drive?"  And the obvious answer is because <NAME/> is moving there.  She rented a really nice loft in down town <NAME/> not far from <NAME/> Field http://astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She took a job with <NAME/> Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thing is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. The good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same business but none-the-less for the same company.\u000a\u000aSecond,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to <NAME/> as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mere coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my house anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  <NAME/> would have no problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiation is in the lead as it stands.\u000a\u000aThird, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV stand, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store the dolls at <NAME/>'s, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in <NAME/> regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furniture or <NAME/> might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk about what is best.\u000a\u000aAnyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the same), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself for trying!\u000a\u000aTake care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTexaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts.  I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.  We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Grigsby\u000a

p8445
aV\u000a\u000aOnly EOL market makers are allowed to use free loading brokers.  Please do not use brokers for markets outside of your market making responsibility.

aV\u000a\u000aAre we making deliveries to this contract?  Please put together a cuts sheet for this deal.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8447
aV\u000a\u000aIt sounds like you do not trust her work, so we should just cut bait and move her into fundies.  Let me know if you really need her for weekends.\u000a
p8448
aV\u000a\u000aFeel free to call Randy <NAME/> and <NAME/> Ermis for Gas Dailies.  I do not have a broker box.  I simply make the markets for CA online. \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8452
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to put a request in for <NAME/> Dornier as well.  We think <NAME/> Huang should move on to another rotation.  He has served the west as an Analyst and believe that he should get experience on another desk.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> Grigsby\u000a
p8453
aV\u000a\u000aPlease place her at 60 or below.  She is under a performance review plan and has been removed from Trading Track.  \u000a\u000aZack McCarroll started with the west desk two weeks ago.  Do we need to add him to the list?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8456
aV\u000a\u000aI am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put <NAME/> South and <NAME/> Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  \u000a\u000aLet me know your thoughts.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8460
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI would rather not get into the habit of locking in curves before the deal is officially closed (signed).  Can we just agree on a sharing policy, so that we may avoid the event underlined below.  I would like to consider the curves floating until it is booked.  We are all sharing the risk of Huber not signing.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aMy new address is 3011 <NAME/> Drive, 77019.  Phone number 713-528-1141.\u000a\u000aWe can worry about this on the next West Desk update.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8466
aV\u000a\u000aWe will meet for thirty minutes before our 3:30 fundies meeting.  \u000a\u000a1.  EOL market making - Lavo has asked us to increase basis liquidity.  <NAME/> has mentioned general theme of market, "why trade on EOL 5000/d and risk moving the market".  We are becoming market framers.  I think <NAME/> Ermis is a pioneer.\u000a\u000a2.  Deal confirmations - <NAME/> Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.  How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.\u000a\u000a3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.

p8471
aV\u000a\u000aLast week it would have been two cents, but now that there is a huge credit spread in the market, it may cost them .07.  We simply can't buy the physical volumes right now.  The credit spread in the SJ to cover our short is costing us .20.  \u000a\u000aI love this market.\u000a
p8472
aV\u000a\u000aJust want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.\u000a\u000aPlease look at the attached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?\u000a\u000aPlease respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPlease trade smaller in the future.  You are doing a great job making the markets  PG&E and Malin, but your positions are getting too large.  Do not stop yourself out today in one move, but rather begin a methodical plan to reduce your risk.  Make a move to get closer to your VAR.\u000a\u000aYou are the <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8474
aV\u000a\u000aHello.  We would like the ability to trade cash with Puget Sound.  It is very difficult to interrupt the business and information that we receive from serving Puget as we near the winter months.  If you need to freeze business to evaluate the impact of the recent ruling, then please freeze baseload business only.\u000a\u000aIn the future, please call me with any credit issues in the west.  <NAME/> <NAME/> is no longer the Desk Director of the west.\u000a\u000aSincerely,\u000a

p8478
aV\u000a\u000aThe P&L was stated incorrectly again.  The new numbers just went out.  We were down 3.7 million on the day, most of that coming from the transport book that falls next to <NAME/>'s name.\u000a\u000aWe clearly have issues with our book runners.  Gossett is trying to fix it, but the surprises keep coming.  \u000a\u000aLet's set up a time to discuss the desk.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

All Rights Reserved \u000aCalifornia officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. \u000aGov. Gray <NAME/> (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for <NAME/>. \u000a"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," <NAME/> told the San <NAME/> Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." \u000aThe new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. \u000aYesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. \u000a"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. \u000aWagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put <NAME/> at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. \u000aLast Friday, Wagner rebuked <NAME/>'s chief representative, <NAME/> Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. \u000aWagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. \u000aWagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. \u000aBut he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., <NAME/> Energy Services, <NAME/> Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. \u000aWagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. \u000a<NAME/>'s tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. \u000aCalifornia 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. \u000aIn response, <NAME/>'s aide, S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. \u000aThat's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. \u000aA new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on <NAME/> and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. <NAME/> will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. \u000aIndustry supporters say <NAME/>'s refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said <NAME/> Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. \u000aThe state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. \u000a"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said <NAME/> Wolak, a <NAME/> University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. \u000aThose polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.\u000a\u000aORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE\u000a     In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray \u000a<NAME/> and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the \u000apaper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of \u000aCalifornia's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With \u000acommentary from <NAME/> Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the \u000aPacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that \u000arequires customers to buy power from their local utility company \u000ais forcing ratepayers to fund <NAME/>'s overpriced energy \u000apurchases.\u000a     The negative impact on California businesses, some already \u000ain a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and \u000adiscourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. \u000aIt's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an \u000aeconomic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County \u000aRegister via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25, \u000ahttp://www.ocregister.com ).\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGovernor wants to cut costs of power \u000aTough sell for <NAME/> as suppliers balk \u000aBy <NAME/> Geissinger\u000aSACRAMENTO BUREAU \u000aSACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray <NAME/> wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. \u000aBut the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. \u000a"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked <NAME/> Cartwright, president of San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. \u000aAnd many experts and analysts are skeptical about <NAME/>' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. \u000a"Good luck!" former Republican Gov. <NAME/> <NAME/> sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. \u000a<NAME/>, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. \u000aThe outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. \u000a"This could save billions of dollars," said <NAME/> Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced <NAME/>' power contract renegotiation plan. \u000a<NAME/> Goode, <NAME/>' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." \u000aThe governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. \u000aThe governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. \u000aThe state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. \u000aThough the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. \u000aThe long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for <NAME/> as he heads into a re-election bid next year. \u000aThe liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at <NAME/> University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. \u000aThe state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. \u000aThe standoff has pitted <NAME/> and Democratic state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader <NAME/> <NAME/> of San <NAME/>, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. \u000a<NAME/> has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." \u000aThe deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. \u000aWithout the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. \u000aThe projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. \u000aAgainst the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. \u000aBut some analysts are pessimistic, like <NAME/>. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames <NAME/> for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. \u000aThe Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. \u000a"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. \u000aIf state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. \u000aHis comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. \u000aHeller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said <NAME/> "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." \u000a"Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSee story below.\u000a\u000aState completes history's largest municipal-bond sale \u000aCalifornia's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis. \u000aThe sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. \u000aAnd it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. \u000aWith the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. \u000aThe slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said. \u000a"We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11." \u000aNow, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. \u000aEarlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California <NAME/> and San <NAME/> Gas & Electric Co. \u000aRepayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. \u000aThe huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. \u000aBut the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. \u000aWith utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President <NAME/> Lynch said Tuesday. \u000aThis year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. \u000aBut Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. \u000aBesides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. \u000a"I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. \u000aTuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. \u000aThe notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. \u000aBut a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. \u000aBesides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. \u000aTuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. \u000a"It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said <NAME/> Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. \u000aAs senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. \u000a"There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said. \u000aThe level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. \u000aThe notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. \u000aHad the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated." \u000aEven so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year."\u000a

And again, let's keep this light.  No frictions.

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Sure you've seen it, but just in case.  Non-energy-related friend of mine emailed it to me.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://www.cfo.com \u000a\u000aCFO.com's\u000aToday in Finance\u000a\u000a\u000a________________________________Sponsor ________________________________\u000a\u000aMonday, October 22, 2001\u000aRelated Party Crashers? SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBy <NAME/> Taub\u000a\u000aThe Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that <NAME/> provide\u000ainformation regarding certain related party transactions. \u000a\u000a"We welcome this request," said <NAME/> L. Lay, <NAME/> chairman and CEO in a\u000aprepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC." \u000a\u000a<NAME/>, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and\u000aelectricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys\u000areviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and\u000aapproved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC\u000afilings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in\u000aconnection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added. \u000a\u000aAs we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial\u000aofficer <NAME/> Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits\u000afrom transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall\u000aStreet Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals\u000awith <NAME/> in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk\u000aof losses. \u000a\u000a\u000aREPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED\u000aLater this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was\u000anearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial\u000aTimes. \u000a\u000aSpecifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues\u000arose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues\u000aclimbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. \u000a\u000aThe reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of\u000aits business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the\u000afirst half of this year. \u000a\u000a"We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period\u000aof great challenge and change in our profession," chairman <NAME/> Turley told\u000athe FT. \u000a\u000aRival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year\u000athrough August 31. \u000a\u000aAnother reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm\u000ais expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local\u000acurrency terms, according to the paper. \u000a\u000aTurley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and\u000aare instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt\u000acovenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant\u000aviolations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT. \u000a\u000aRead On!

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aA few thoughts:\u000aConference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with <NAME/>.\u000aIf the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, <NAME/> won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.\u000aNo matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.\u000aThe proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.\u000aAssignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).\u000aThe proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.\u000aGiven the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.\u000aAll that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea.\u000aI'd propose that we continue with <NAME/>. If <NAME/> bites, then go jointly with <NAME/> to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with <NAME/> and QF to try to persuade ORA.\u000aOn the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.\u000a\u000aSome preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8532
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for your efforts, thanks for trying, and thanks for your strong sense of decency.  If there's anything whatsoever I can do to assist, don't hesitate.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI just got it.  I'll fax it.  Trying to read, but am currently reading the latest version of SB 78, which we just got and <NAME/> has faxed.  <NAME/>, here's the latest.  It's going to be heard this afternoon, per <NAME/>'s note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether <NAME/> will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (<NAME/> bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  <NAME/> report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8534
aV\u000a\u000aHere's what I'll do.  I'll go back and look at the materials they sent us.  Maybe you could do the same, so at least we have an idea of what they'll claim our "contribution" is.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8536
aV\u000a\u000aQuck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with <NAME/>.  1) Do we care that D. <NAME/> will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that <NAME/> sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFor you, anything.  My kingdom for a Kaufman...\u000a
p8541
aV\u000a\u000aHere's my take.  <NAME/>'s got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if <NAME/> wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of <NAME/> traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if <NAME/> ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.  \u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

A year ago, about 30 percent of Calpine's power was\u000a> under contract, he said.\u000a>\u000a> Calpine, one of the largest U.S. power-plant builders, has been buying\u000a> natural-gas fields to supply its power plants, spending about $1.9 billion\u000a> from March last year to July to boost gas reserves to 1.5 trillion cubic\u000a> feet. It also has bought gas in futures markets to help fix margins on\u000a> electricity sales, Macias said.\u000a>\u000a> ``The California crisis, while not desired, has been a tremendous\u000a> opportunity,'' Macias said. ``Calpine may be the only player emerging from\u000a> the crisis with no overhang issues. We are emerging stronger than ever.''\u000a>\u000a> The long-term contracts have an average ``spark spread,'' or the\u000adifference\u000a> between revenue and the cost of fuel to generate the electricity, of\u000a$26.50\u000a> a megawatt-hour, Macias said. One megawatt-hour is enough energy to light\u000a> 750 typical California homes for an hour.\u000a>\u000a> California has $43 billion in long-term energy contracts with Calpine and\u000a> other generators. The state's Department of Water Resources began buying\u000a> power on behalf of its three investor-owned utilities in January after the\u000a> two largest, owned by PG&E Corp. and <NAME/> International, became\u000ainsolvent\u000a> buying power for more than they were allowed to charge customers.\u000a>\u000a> San <NAME/>, California-based Calpine expects $16 billion in revenue over the\u000a> next 20 years from contracts with the department, PG&E, the city of San\u000a> <NAME/>, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other agencies.\u000a> Most of the contracts are for 10 years or less.\u000a>\u000a> PG&E Payment\u000a>\u000a> Calpine is owed $267 million by PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's\u000a> largest utility, which filed for bankruptcy protection in April after\u000a> accruing $9 billion in power-buying losses. Calpine expects to be paid\u000awith\u000a> interest after Pacific Gas submits its reorganization plan later this\u000ayear,\u000a> <NAME/> Bodensteiner, Calpine's general counsel, said on the call.\u000a>\u000a> Calpine isn't owed money by <NAME/>'s Southern California <NAME/>, which is\u000a> negotiating a rescue plan with state lawmakers to keep California's No. 2\u000a> utility out of bankruptcy, Macias said.\u000a>\u000a> Shares of Calpine fell 45 cents to $33.25. They have dropped 26 percent\u000athis\u000a> year.\u000a> --\u000a> *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\u000a>\u000a> Bentham Paulos\u000a> Energy Foundation\u000a> ben@ef.org\u000a>\u000a>\u000a> ------------------------ Yahoo!

aV\u000a\u000aHere's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.\u000a\u000aFYI:  <NAME/> and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with <NAME/> Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.\u000a\u000aFinally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. \u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a  \u000a1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  \u000a\u000a2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.\u000a\u000a3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)\u000a\u000a4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. \u000a\u000aAdditional suggestions from <NAME/> Day:\u000a\u000a5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.\u000a\u000a6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPower providers cry foul over fees \u000aState is accused of improper billing \u000aElectricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray <NAME/>' administration. \u000aThe power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. \u000aEnergy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as <NAME/>, Dynegy, <NAME/> and Reliant. \u000aThe charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. \u000a"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said. \u000aAn industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. \u000aThe commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. \u000aState officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. \u000a<NAME/> Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. \u000a"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said. \u000aThe governor's spokesman, <NAME/> Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. \u000a"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement." \u000a<NAME/> Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. \u000a"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a year." \u000a<NAME/> Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. \u000aEnergy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. \u000aThe extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. \u000aSome firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. \u000aThe accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, <NAME/> disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. <NAME/> appointed his own five-member board. \u000aIn February, then-FERC Chairman <NAME/> Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. \u000a<NAME/> has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTHE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS\u000aAll faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20. This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: <NAME/> Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and <NAME/> Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of <NAME/> Schwab & Co., Inc. \u000a\u000aThe annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.\u000a\u000aDubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with <NAME/> Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The <NAME/> Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address. \u000a\u000aSawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the <NAME/> University Graduate School of Business. \u000a\u000aThroughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops. Panels planned for this year's conference include: \u000a+ Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate \u000a+ Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World \u000a+ International Business \u000a+ Wild Women \u000a\u000aThis year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P.

aV\u000a\u000aBattle lines drawn over long-term power deals \u000aSD Union Tribune, 10.07.01\u000aIn a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. \u000aThis time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. \u000aIn a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. \u000aConsumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. \u000aBut business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California <NAME/>, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. \u000aAs massive as the <NAME/> deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. \u000aOr maybe not. \u000aWhile electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. \u000aCritics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. \u000aDuress alleged\u000aConsumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. \u000a"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said <NAME/> Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." \u000aAhern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. \u000a<NAME/> Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San <NAME/>, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. \u000a"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. \u000a"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. \u000aShames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. \u000aNow it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. \u000aBeyond the growing political pressure, San <NAME/> attorney <NAME/> Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray <NAME/> overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. \u000aHe says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. \u000a"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." \u000aThe PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. \u000a"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said <NAME/> Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.\u000aWillingness to deal\u000aAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. \u000aThe federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. \u000aCohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. \u000aFor his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. \u000a"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said <NAME/> Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." \u000aSome experts believe <NAME/> wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. \u000aPower providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. \u000a"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said <NAME/> Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. \u000aThe San <NAME/> company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. \u000aSempra says contract fair\u000aThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. \u000aSan <NAME/>-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. \u000a<NAME/> Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. \u000a"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. \u000aBut V. <NAME/> White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. \u000aWhite says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. \u000a"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. \u000a"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" \u000a*****************************************************************\u000aState authority buying more power for 2002 \u000aCritics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss \u000aOC Register, 10.07.01\u000aSACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. \u000aMoreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. \u000aThe new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. \u000aMany observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. \u000a"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) <NAME/> <NAME/> is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said <NAME/> Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. \u000aA draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. \u000aWithout the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. \u000aIn a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. \u000aPower authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, an authority board member. \u000aSaid <NAME/>: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." \u000aNew contracts would increase 'green' power \u000aIn addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. \u000aSuch generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. \u000aThe remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. \u000aThe emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. \u000aNonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. \u000a"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said <NAME/> Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. \u000aBusinesses worry new pacts will hurt them \u000aEven the state's businesses are critical. \u000aThey believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. \u000aLawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. \u000aLawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. \u000a"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said <NAME/> <NAME/>, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. \u000aThe state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is <NAME/>, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of <NAME/>' closest advisers during the energy crisis. \u000aThe Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. \u000a"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman <NAME/> Keeley, D-<NAME/>, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' \u000aKeeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. \u000a<NAME/> said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. \u000a"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' <NAME/> said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> devises new borrowing plan \u000aHis executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. \u000aSACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray <NAME/> is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. \u000aThe plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged <NAME/> last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. \u000aWith enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. \u000a"That is one scenario," <NAME/> spokeswoman <NAME/> McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." \u000aMost involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. \u000a<NAME/> wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. \u000aThe PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the <NAME/>-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. \u000aThe PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the <NAME/> plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, <NAME/> appointee <NAME/> Lynch. \u000a<NAME/> earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. \u000aThe plan now under review, however, would bypass that. \u000aThe DWR would not directly set rates, but under the <NAME/> plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. \u000aThe administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. \u000aLynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether <NAME/> had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. \u000a"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." \u000aThe governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/>, D-San <NAME/>. \u000a<NAME/> opposes <NAME/>'s bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which <NAME/> believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. \u000aIf <NAME/> signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIn case you hadn't seen it, your pal Vikram's taking some pretty hard knocks right about now.  <NAME/> all is well.\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000aConsumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity \u000aLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. \u000aThe Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies\u000aWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said <NAME/> Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." \u000aThree weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, <NAME/> Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by <NAME/> during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the <NAME/> contract was signed. \u000a"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the <NAME/> contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." \u000aThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. \u000aThe Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. \u000aThe California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San <NAME/> Chronicle reported Monday. \u000aThe CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \u000aCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aProbing the 'palace coup' \u000aElectricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. \u000aSeptember 26, 2001 \u000aBy KIMBERLY KINDY\u000aThe Orange County Register \u000aSACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. \u000aThe investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa <NAME/>, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." \u000aLawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. \u000aThe central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. \u000aWinter defied his own board and Gov. Gray <NAME/> when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. \u000a"I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. \u000aThe subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. \u000a<NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. \u000a"The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. \u000aWinter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman <NAME/> Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. \u000a"It was an emergency," Fishman said. \u000a"We had to take action.'' \u000aWhat became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. \u000a"They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. \u000a"All hell broke loose.'' \u000aRecords show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. \u000a"If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by <NAME/> Energy Vice President <NAME/> Hall III. \u000aAlthough there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. \u000aIn the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. \u000aThe generators got their way. \u000aThe next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. \u000aPower producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. \u000aThey began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. \u000aWhat followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. \u000aWinter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. \u000aNeither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, <NAME/> Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. \u000a"In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. \u000aWith the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. \u000a"The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." \u000aPrices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. \u000aDunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. \u000aRobinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. \u000aRobinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. \u000a"We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." \u000aJan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. \u000a"Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. \u000a"He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." \u000aThe ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. \u000a<NAME/> J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. \u000a"They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. \u000a"They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." \u000aWhat Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. \u000a"We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aLADWP, Run By <NAME/> Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis\u000a\u000aDow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones\u000a\u000a\u000a   By <NAME/> Leopold\u000a   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\u000a\u000a\u000a  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles\u000aDepartment of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,\u000araked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a\u000amegawatt-hour\u000a- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.\u000a\u000a  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and\u000aconfirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances\u000ain\u000awhich the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.\u000a\u000a  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been\u000apurchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's\u000acash-strapped\u000autilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing\u000athe\u000aLADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from\u000aJan.\u000a18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those\u000acharged\u000aby most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray <NAME/> has criticized\u000arepeatedly\u000aas price gougers.\u000a\u000a  Potentially embarrassing for the <NAME/> administration, however, is that\u000athe\u000aLADWP was formerly run by General Manager <NAME/> <NAME/>, who in April became\u000a<NAME/>' top energy adviser.\u000a\u000a  <NAME/> Maviglio, press secretary to <NAME/>, said Texas-based generators are\u000aprimarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's\u000atwo\u000alargest utilities.\u000a\u000a  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across\u000atheir\u000aface, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly\u000athe\u000aout-of-state generators."\u000a\u000a  <NAME/>'s trademark is a white Stetson.\u000a\u000a  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could\u000amake money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return\u000acalls\u000afor comment.\u000a\u000a  <NAME/> took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate\u000along-term power contracts on behalf of the state.\u000a\u000a     Power To Sell\u000a\u000a\u000a  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling\u000apower\u000ato the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.\u000a\u000a  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and\u000awhich isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed\u000ain\u000athroughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but\u000aonly\u000aneeds about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as\u000amuch\u000aas 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators\u000awere\u000acharging.\u000a\u000a  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt\u000aand\u000awill reduce its customers' rates in 2002.\u000a\u000a  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," <NAME/> said in\u000aan\u000ainterview last year.\u000a\u000a  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity\u000ashortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at\u000afavorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."\u000a\u000a  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,\u000athe\u000aLADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001\u000aby as\u000amuch as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the\u000autility.\u000a\u000a  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying\u000athe\u000acosts of producing electricity were extremely high.\u000a\u000a  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for\u000aelectricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement\u000atalks\u000abetween state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.\u000a\u000a  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility\u000a<NAME/>\u000aand private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous\u000asums\u000aselling surplus power to California at the last minute.\u000a\u000a  -By <NAME/> Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;\u000ajason.leopold@dowjones.com\u000a\u000a\u000a  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01\u000a\u000a  1557EDT\u000a\u000a(AP-DJ)--07-10-01 1557EDT\u000a:TICKER: EIX PCG SRE\u000a:SUBJECT: EUTL CA COBO MU PETR\u000aCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones and Company, Inc.\u000aReceived by NewsEDGE/LAN: 7/10/01 12:57 PM\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Note discussion of <NAME/>, <NAME/> and the 21st Century Energy Project at end of article.\u000aBest, <NAME/>\u000a++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\u000aCampaign funds will pay for spots \u000a<NAME/> Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau\u000aSaturday, July 7, 2001 \u000a?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle \u000aSacramento -- Gov. Gray <NAME/> will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. \u000a<NAME/> political adviser <NAME/> South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking <NAME/>. \u000a"The campaign season has started early," said <NAME/> Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-<NAME/> TV spots running since June 19. \u000a<NAME/>' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three <NAME/> opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." \u000a<NAME/>' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention <NAME/>. <NAME/>' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. \u000aSouth dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make <NAME/> a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing <NAME/> in Red Square. \u000a"One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." \u000aStutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. \u000a"These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." \u000a<NAME/> already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of <NAME/> standing with actor <NAME/> Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. \u000a"What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether <NAME/> would run against President Bush in 2004. \u000aLast month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming <NAME/> for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." \u000aTime magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking <NAME/>, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." \u000aReliant, which donated $10,000 to <NAME/> before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-<NAME/> advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. \u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>, a former campaign manager for <NAME/> Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. \u000aEven though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and <NAME/>' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. \u000aBut the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. \u000a<NAME/> recently hired former <NAME/>-Gore campaign and White House strategists <NAME/> Lehane and <NAME/> Fabiani, and <NAME/>' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. \u000aAnother conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. \u000aThe $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by <NAME/> Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for <NAME/>'s <NAME/> Corp., the world's largest energy trader. \u000aGillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the <NAME/> Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. \u000a"We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said. \u000aE-mail <NAME/> Salladay at rsalladay@sfchronicle.com. \u000a?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle   Page A - 6\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.\u000a\u000aWork will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)\u000aWork done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.\u000aBecause no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," <NAME/> MOU)\u000aIn addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. \u000aTo move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.\u000aThe committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.\u000aJuly 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.\u000aThe PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)\u000aAll of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (<NAME/>) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  In case you hadn't seen it.  Interestingly, no mention of the transfer of the gas assets.\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000aPG&E restructuring bid draws state ire \u000aBy Dale Kasler and <NAME/> Peyton\u000aBee Staff Writers \u000a(Published Sept. 21, 2001)\u000a\u000aIn a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. \u000aTo make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. \u000aPG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. \u000aThe plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San <NAME/>, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. \u000aBut it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray <NAME/> and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \u000aFERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," <NAME/> told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." \u000aThe PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President <NAME/> Lynch. \u000aConsumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said <NAME/> Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San <NAME/>. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." \u000aFiled six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. \u000aThat would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California <NAME/>. \u000aPG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge <NAME/> Montali has sided with state officials. \u000a"Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. <NAME/> Bowen, D-<NAME/> del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. \u000a<NAME/> D. <NAME/> Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. \u000aBut that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. \u000aAnd <NAME/> Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. \u000a"This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. \u000aDespite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. \u000aThe plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. \u000a<NAME/> said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. \u000aWhile the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, <NAME/> insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. \u000aThe PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with <NAME/> for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at <NAME/>' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for <NAME/>. \u000aIt's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on <NAME/>'s attempt to avoid bankruptcy. <NAME/>'s creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the <NAME/>-backed plan, might conclude that <NAME/> is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. \u000aThe PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. \u000aThe utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. \u000aThe bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. \u000aDespite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman <NAME/> Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. <NAME/> said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. \u000aAlso, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst <NAME/> Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. \u000aIf state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." \u000aThe plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said <NAME/> Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. \u000a"There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. \u000a<NAME/> Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. \u000aShareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI think that we should pursue both.  If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.  If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.  Thoughts?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSenate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues 	\u000a<NAME/> Kuhnhenn 	\u000a	\u000a 	\u000a07/06/2001 	\u000aKRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau 	\u000a	\u000a	\u000a	\u000aCopyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) 	\u000a 	\u000a	\u000a 	\u000aWASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader <NAME/> Daschle wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other initiatives popular with Democrats.  Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both sides see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sign. 	\u000a	\u000a   "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go with," said Democratic pollster <NAME/> Yang. "It's an issue that people actually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House. Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of Representatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed with support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House soundly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," said Daschle spokeswoman <NAME/> Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key committees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and other issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy policy first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President <NAME/> Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From the moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energy needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 percent end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. <NAME/> Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. It will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Department. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fending off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling near Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservation and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for sport utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later this month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republicans such as <NAME/> Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and <NAME/> Collins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. <NAME/> McCain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservation measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue," said <NAME/> Wittman, a senior fellow at the conservative <NAME/> Institute research center and a political adviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- encouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environmentally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He also has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for spending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the president is not backing away from his position that the United States needs to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energy plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay for research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rolling blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and last week <NAME/> Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Like the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, energy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aConsumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity \u000a \u000aLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. \u000a\u000aThe Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies\u000a\u000aWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said <NAME/> Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." \u000aThree weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, <NAME/> Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by <NAME/> during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the <NAME/> contract was signed. \u000a\u000a"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the <NAME/> contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." \u000a\u000aThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. \u000a\u000aThe Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. \u000a\u000aThe California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San <NAME/> Chronicle reported Monday. \u000a\u000aThe CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \u000a\u000aCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. \u000a\u000aBudhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBattle lines drawn over long-term power deals \u000aSD Union Tribune, 10.07.01\u000aIn a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. \u000aThis time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. \u000aIn a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. \u000aConsumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. \u000aBut business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California <NAME/>, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. \u000aAs massive as the <NAME/> deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. \u000aOr maybe not. \u000aWhile electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. \u000aCritics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. \u000aDuress alleged\u000aConsumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. \u000a"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said <NAME/> Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." \u000aAhern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. \u000a<NAME/> Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San <NAME/>, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. \u000a"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. \u000a"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. \u000aShames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. \u000aNow it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. \u000aBeyond the growing political pressure, San <NAME/> attorney <NAME/> Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray <NAME/> overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. \u000aHe says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. \u000a"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." \u000aThe PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. \u000a"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said <NAME/> Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.\u000aWillingness to deal\u000aAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. \u000aThe federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. \u000aCohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. \u000aFor his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. \u000a"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said <NAME/> Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." \u000aSome experts believe <NAME/> wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. \u000aPower providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. \u000a"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said <NAME/> Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. \u000aThe San <NAME/> company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. \u000aSempra says contract fair\u000aThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. \u000aSan <NAME/>-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. \u000a<NAME/> Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. \u000a"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. \u000aBut V. <NAME/> White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. \u000aWhite says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. \u000a"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. \u000a"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" \u000a*****************************************************************\u000aState authority buying more power for 2002 \u000aCritics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss \u000aOC Register, 10.07.01\u000aSACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. \u000aMoreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. \u000aThe new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. \u000aMany observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. \u000a"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) <NAME/> <NAME/> is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said <NAME/> Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. \u000aA draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. \u000aWithout the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. \u000aIn a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. \u000aPower authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, an authority board member. \u000aSaid <NAME/>: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." \u000aNew contracts would increase 'green' power \u000aIn addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. \u000aSuch generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. \u000aThe remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. \u000aThe emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. \u000aNonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. \u000a"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said <NAME/> Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. \u000aBusinesses worry new pacts will hurt them \u000aEven the state's businesses are critical. \u000aThey believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. \u000aLawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. \u000aLawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. \u000a"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said <NAME/> <NAME/>, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. \u000aThe state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is <NAME/>, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of <NAME/>' closest advisers during the energy crisis. \u000aThe Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. \u000a"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman <NAME/> Keeley, D-<NAME/>, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' \u000aKeeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. \u000a<NAME/> said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. \u000a"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' <NAME/> said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the <NAME/> MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.\u000aIf and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.\u000aIt will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.\u000aIf and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.\u000aThat said, <NAME/> is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.\u000a<NAME/> report back with the events of the Assembly.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000acall me.  thanks.  dasovich 415.782.7822.\u000a
p8691
aV\u000a\u000aAny time.  Just call.\u000a
p8692
aV\u000a\u000aLook like the stuff?\u000a
p8693
aV\u000a\u000aThere's a tourney tomorrow, and those NOT in the tourney can play on a first-come, first-serve basis from noon to 2PM.  I say that we get to the club by 11:45 AM.  You guys game?\u000a
p8694
aV\u000a\u000aSee what a good night sleep can do!  We'll set up the meeting and determine the attendance list.\u000a
p8695
aV\u000a\u000aHi.  Hey, I can't open this.\u000a\u000aHugs,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8696
aV\u000a\u000aLooks like Prentice and <NAME/> will be getting together in Napa to do a little bonding this weekend.  Therefore, it looks like an opportunity to golf on Saturday or Sunday (screw football).  Any takers?  (<NAME/> has promised not to be the score Nazi.) \u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8697
aV\u000a\u000aIn response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including <NAME/>--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."\u000aThe California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.\u000aMany of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.\u000aIn its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.\u000aKey among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  \u000aThose comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.\u000aThe Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.\u000aIf you would like a copy of the decision, please contact <NAME/> Alamo.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21\u000a
p8698
aV\u000a\u000aThere was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact <NAME/> <NAME/> (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8699
aV\u000a\u000aCould be a soon as the next week or two.  We'll make sure that you're up to date on the latest.\u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8700
aV\u000a\u000aQuick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.\u000a
p8701
aV\u000a\u000aThe Bond Legislation\u000aThe Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. \u000aBut the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  \u000aThe bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. \u000aThe Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.\u000a\u000aThe Conference Committee\u000aSenator <NAME/> does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.\u000aUsing the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.\u000aNo sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though <NAME/> continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."\u000a\u000aThe Core/Noncore Legislative Language\u000aThe negotiating group continues to work on the language.\u000aThe language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.\u000a\u000aSenator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing\u000aThe hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8702
aV\u000a\u000aIt's safer there.\u000a
p8703
aV\u000a\u000aGreat question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to <NAME/> and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  \u000a\u000aBut I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if <NAME/> thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8704
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t want to leave you in the lurch, though.\u000a
p8705
aV\u000a\u000ahmmm.  my understanding is that prentice has a full plate this weekend, but don't know her precise schedule, so I was going to the dome to meet with dottie's cousin and the apple tree guy, and try to make some more progress finishing the cabin.\u000a
p8706
aV\u000a\u000aCentrica's gain.  <NAME/>'s loss.  The very best of luck to you.  It certainly has been a pleasure and I hope our paths cross again soon.\u000a\u000aAll the best,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p8714
aV\u000a\u000aGreetings:\u000aI just talked to <NAME/>.  She's interested, but wants some more info to examine before setting up a meeting.  Aren't there some press articles about the sort of muni partnerships you want to pursue with SMUD and Anaheim?  Do we have anything else that I can email to her to wet her whistle for the meeting?  <NAME/> get back to you very soon about meeting with Schori at SMUD.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aRiordan edges out <NAME/> in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis.\u000aBy <NAME/> <NAME/>\u000aBee Political Editor\u000a(Published Sept. 26, 2001) \u000aGov. Gray <NAME/> survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. \u000aThe poll showed <NAME/> narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor <NAME/> Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. \u000aRiordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to <NAME/> from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, <NAME/> DiCamillo. \u000a"It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said. "It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis." \u000aIn a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State <NAME/> Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman <NAME/> <NAME/> trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. \u000aThe poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. \u000a<NAME/> political adviser <NAME/> South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading." \u000a"These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said. "These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general." \u000aDiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of <NAME/>' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. \u000aIn May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of <NAME/>' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. \u000aVoters also said they were not inclined to re-elect <NAME/>, 50 percent to 43 percent. \u000a"Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said. "He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. \u000a"No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating <NAME/>, and it's still negative." \u000aDiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. \u000aRiordan adviser <NAME/> Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for <NAME/>. \u000a"It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know <NAME/> Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray <NAME/> plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way." \u000aSouth said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. <NAME/> <NAME/> was trailing Democrat <NAME/> Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. \u000a"We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942." \u000aThe Bee's <NAME/> <NAME/> can be reached at (916) 326-5535 or achance@sacbee.com <mailto:achance@sacbee.com>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTalked to Craver's office. His office is going to get back to me about meeting at <NAME/> early next week.  That work for you?\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPLEASE do not overreact, but I want you to have this information.  Hang in there everyone.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe person's name at Calpine is <NAME/> Macias (he's a vice president there).  His number 408.995.5115.\u000a\u000aThanks again, Marchris.  How'd the conversation go?  If there's anything that I can do to help, don't hesitate.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8719
aV\u000a\u000aYesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points. \u000a\u000aThe contracts <NAME/> signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.\u000aIf elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate <NAME/>' Public Power Authority.\u000aIf elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.\u000a\u000aI'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8720
aV\u000a\u000aSweetheart, very sorry to hear.  You're in my thoughts and prayers and I hope you're doing OK.  Sometimes, things just aren't very fair.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8721
aV\u000a\u000aMan, makes California look like a second rate circus.  You two are having all the fun.  Surprisingly refreshing to hear that Massey put it to them.\u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000aPS  I want you two to be the first to know I'm leaving.......\u000a

p8723
aV\u000a\u000aGreetings:\u000aCould I get an electronic copy of your request to the CPUC to extend Gas Accord until 2005?  You think they'll approve?  When are comments due?  We want to support you.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000adon't worry about it.  i'm just sending the check now.  whenever you get the wine is fine.  and thanks again for doing it.\u000a
p8726
aV\u000a\u000aUnder the circumstances, I am leaning toward cancelling (I was originally only going to participate on Monday anyway, and <NAME/> hadn't planned on attending. Neither <NAME/> nor <NAME/> can attend.)  If there's a compelling reason that you think I should attend, let me know.  Otherwise I'll let Bev know that we'll take a rain check on this one.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8727
aV\u000a\u000aHap: I've been in a panic.  I will review shortly and get back to you just as soon as I can.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8728
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aBased on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., <NAME/> White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.\u000a**************************************************************************\u000a\u000aReduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%\u000aTo "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position\u000aDA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts\u000aElection is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position\u000aCustomers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)\u000aIf a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short\u000aThe auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.\u000aNoncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)\u000aLikewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status\u000aNoncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.\u000aPotential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.\u000a
p8729
aV\u000a\u000adude:  you guys won first (even after those bad picks you made).  Congratz.\u000a\u000adon't look over your shoulder, cuz we're right on your heels!\u000a
p8730
aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Big customers were hesitant to sign on to the ARM filing, but they were cajoled into filing on their own.  They seem to hit the mark pretty well.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8731
aV\u000a\u000aThank you.  Pretty interesting.\u000a
p8732
aV\u000a\u000aThanks, very much <NAME/>.  Hedy, Bev and <NAME/> are still technically on board until the end of the month, but that's fairly "ceremonial," so to speak.  Let's do this.  I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.  Sound reasonable?\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8733
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aIs this also information that you'd like to be kept apprised of.  Just let me know.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aNo problem.  Thanks for re-forwarding.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  <NAME/> is out for the week.  Is there someone who <NAME/> works for that I could contact?  Thanks much.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8736
aV\u000a\u000aIt's more complicated still.  A crazy commissioner at the CPUC now wants to require everyone to submit their DA contracts to Commission for review.  It's attached.  Folks are going to oppose it very strongly.  I'm available to talk.  I'm not sure that the Oct. 5th date has got legs.\u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGetting alot of inquiries.\u000a\u000aThe PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.\u000aLikely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.\u000aLooks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  \u000aIn addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).\u000aThree key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).\u000a\u000aKEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.\u000a\u000aWe'll report back as soon as something happens.\u000a\u000aFor folks who want to listen in, the number is:\u000a\u000a415.228.4550\u000acode = 92105\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8741
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  the decision we talked about yesterday is to cover DWR costs for the period Jan. '01-Dec' 02.  Recall that SDG&E did not get the rate increases that PG&E and <NAME/> got.  The charge (I believe) is $14.6/Mwh on a system ave. basis.  If there's anything else you need, let me know.  This decision does not deal with the "undercollection" SDG&E has accrued due to the price cap put in place by previous Legislation.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8742
aV\u000a\u000agiven the mess out here, and how long it's been going on, howzabout "deep therapy?"\u000a
p8743
aV\u000a\u000aHere's the proposal:\u000a\u000aThere is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all <NAME/> has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by <NAME/> on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.\u000aThe PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)\u000aIf, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.\u000a\u000aThoughts?\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aConsumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity \u000aLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. \u000aThe Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies\u000aWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said <NAME/> Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." \u000aThree weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, <NAME/> Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by <NAME/> during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the <NAME/> contract was signed. \u000a"It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the <NAME/> contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." \u000aThe groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. \u000aThe Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. \u000aThe California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San <NAME/> Chronicle reported Monday. \u000aThe CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. \u000aCPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance <NAME/> LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. \u000aBudhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCalif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit \u000aNEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. \u000aThe treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. \u000a"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. \u000aThe state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. \u000a"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. \u000aEarlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. \u000aAngelides said PUC Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President <NAME/> Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." \u000aLynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. \u000aHow the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. \u000aAngelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. \u000aIn a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. \u000aThe treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. \u000aAngelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. \u000aOr, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. \u000aEighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPublished Tuesday, July 10,  2001 \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aState discloses spot power  buys\u000a\u000aBy <NAME/>  LaMar\u000aTIMES STAFF WRITER  \u000a\u000a\u000aSACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  \u000a\u000aAll told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  \u000a\u000aThe data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  \u000a\u000aAgencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  \u000a\u000aReceiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  \u000a\u000aThe total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Sellers  \u000a\u000aThe following is a partial list of companies that sold electricity into the  California spot power market from Jan. 18 through May 31.

aV\u000a\u000aCalif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit \u000aNEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. \u000aThe treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. \u000a"What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. \u000aThe state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. \u000a"There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. \u000aEarlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. \u000aAngelides said PUC Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President <NAME/> Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." \u000aLynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. \u000aHow the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. \u000aAngelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. \u000aIn a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. \u000aThe treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. \u000aAngelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. \u000aOr, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. \u000aEighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCalifornia Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By <NAME/> Taub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray <NAME/>'s office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information <NAME/> has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said.  <NAME/> is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, <NAME/> appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPUC and <NAME/> Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates\u000aThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California <NAME/> (<NAME/>) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit <NAME/> filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore <NAME/> to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling <NAME/> to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:\u000a?	<NAME/> will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and <NAME/> have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt <NAME/> had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.\u000a?	<NAME/> will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If <NAME/> has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether <NAME/> will pay a dividend in 2004.  <NAME/> is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since <NAME/>'s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, <NAME/>'s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.\u000a?	<NAME/> will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  <NAME/> commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.\u000a?	The PUC can direct <NAME/> to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the <NAME/> debt. \u000a?	The PUC agrees not to lower <NAME/>'s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.\u000a?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable <NAME/> to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if <NAME/>'s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. \u000a?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over <NAME/>, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.\u000a?	<NAME/> may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.\u000a"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for <NAME/> to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said <NAME/> Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."\u000aThis agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by <NAME/> against the PUC, in which <NAME/> claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, <NAME/> will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.\u000a

May want to add the great job <NAME/> did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.

We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. \u000a\u000aI have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named <NAME/> Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  <NAME/> has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aWith that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than <NAME/> (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.\u000a\u000aThanks for your time and hope all is well.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCommissioners <NAME/> M. Duque and <NAME/> A. Bilas, dissenting:\u000a\u000aOne could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.\u000a\u000aWe are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. \u000a\u000aSomething else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. \u000a\u000a	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  \u000a\u000a	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. \u000a\u000aFor these reasons we must respectfully dissent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a/s/ HENRY M.

Here are some quick thoughts.  <NAME/> likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.\u000a\u000aRepublican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.\u000aWas a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.\u000aRepublican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that <NAME/> Wright chairs).\u000a<NAME/>'t recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.\u000aIn fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.\u000aWhen push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.\u000aEven when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up <NAME/>' ridiculous bailout bills in <NAME/> Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.\u000aAnd even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.\u000aCan't recall a time that he's been there for us.\u000a\u000aI'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the <NAME/> level to contact him, that's great, too.

aV\u000a\u000aDear folks:\u000a<NAME/> all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  <NAME/> to see all of you very soon.  Be safe.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8878
aV\u000a\u000agot that one covered too while you were out.\u000a
p8879
aV\u000a\u000aFolks:\u000aHere are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.\u000a\u000aThey are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.\u000a\u000aPlease take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aIn addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.\u000a\u000aFinally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.\u000a\u000aThanks again to all for all the effort (and to <NAME/> for her patience in hearing me out earlier).\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey:\u000aJust heard back from <NAME/>.  He's not cancelling.  Just post-poning.  Lots--and I mean lots--going on.  I think that, realistically, we're talking December.

p8892
aV\u000a\u000aTalked to <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aFirst thing he has to do is convince <NAME/>' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.\u000aHe should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.\u000aI told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.\u000aHe said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.\u000aHe's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.\u000aI'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?\u000aI asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p8893
aV\u000a\u000aSince it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  <NAME/>fully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  <NAME/> it's not creating undue headaches.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThough there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when <NAME/> will call back the California legislature to address the <NAME/> MOU, here's the latest information we have.\u000aFaced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (<NAME/>), <NAME/> is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.\u000aRumors of a delay come despite <NAME/>' statements that he would call them back next week.\u000aWe received the information about a likely delay from an <NAME/> SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.\u000aIt's <NAME/>'s view that the earliest <NAME/> would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.\u000aAt this point, the chance remains that <NAME/> may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving <NAME/> to follow PG&E into chapter 11.\u000aIn the meantime, negotiations between <NAME/>' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.\u000a\u000aWe'll report back with information as we get it.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCalled Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with <NAME/>'s bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at <NAME/> scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks.

aV\u000a\u000aPlease forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to <NAME/> about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.  I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.  Let me know if I'm missing something here.

aV\u000a\u000aGreetings Ms Kahl:\u000a\u000aFew things:\u000a\u000a1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of <NAME/>'s current financial "challenges."\u000a2)	Could you forward <NAME/>'s email address to me?\u000a3)	Are you aware of what <NAME/>'s going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from <NAME/> at the time that <NAME/> 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to <NAME/>.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.\u000a\u000aOne of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether <NAME/> Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., <NAME/> will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?\u000a\u000aInquiring minds want to know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you're well.

aV\u000a\u000aSo you're the one who gave me this cold.  Just wanted to let you know that I've been working on the resume (in between work and finals) and will try to have you a draft by end of this week, or next Monday.  Get better.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aGood talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).\u000a\u000aBased on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from their shop that will be in <NAME/> are:\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Sullivan\u000aSVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product\u000a\u000aCameron Sellers\u000aVP, Business Development\u000a\u000aThey'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and <NAME/>.  Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.\u000a\u000aI ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.\u000a\u000aI've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.  From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.\u000a\u000aThe technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by <NAME/> Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at <NAME/>).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including <NAME/>.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."\u000a"<NAME/>'s the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or <NAME/> or Sweden, <NAME/> creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  <NAME/> is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by <NAME/>\u000aBy <NAME/> B. Marois \u000aSacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for <NAME/> International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray <NAME/> said. \u000aThe governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San <NAME/> time, <NAME/> spokeswoman <NAME/> McLean said. \u000aSouthern California <NAME/>, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. \u000aThe Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting <NAME/> to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. \u000aThe latest <NAME/> measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, <NAME/> aides said last week.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGreetings:\u000a\u000a<NAME/> everyone had a pleasant 4th.\u000a\u000aI've read the respective <NAME/> and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The <NAME/> language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.\u000a\u000aI'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:\u000a\u000aCustomers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. \u000a\u000aIn short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.\u000a\u000aCustomers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  \u000a\u000aFor example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.\u000a\u000aI believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.\u000a\u000aIn addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.\u000a\u000aWith this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.\u000a\u000aFinally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?\u000a\u000aLook forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.\u000a\u000aThe project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.\u000aThe deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.\u000aFor the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.\u000aBy contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.\u000aIn short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.\u000aWe are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.\u000aTherefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.\u000a\u000aThanks for listening.

aV\u000a\u000aUSA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study.\u000aNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said. \u000aBut there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. \u000aAccording to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. \u000a"Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. \u000aSwezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the <NAME/> Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. \u000aThe study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. \u000a"If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of <NAME/> Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. \u000aCALIFORNIA CAVEAT \u000aGreen power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . \u000aBut in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. \u000a"The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. \u000aMore than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. \u000aNon-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. \u000aWith the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade. \u000aNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel. \u000a<NAME/> Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .\u000a

This is it in a nutshell:\u000a1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to <NAME/>'s undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; \u000a2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;\u000a3.	<NAME/> says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. \u000a4.	<NAME/> intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  <NAME/> estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.\u000a5.	Under <NAME/>'s plan, <NAME/> would likely end up paying <NAME/>, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.\u000a?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with <NAME/>, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.\u000a?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and <NAME/> 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.\u000a?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose <NAME/>'s proposal at the PUC.\u000a?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.\u000a?	We are scheduled to meet with <NAME/> again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).\u000a\u000aIf you have any questions, let us know.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI. Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away....\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a****************************************************\u000aPUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in <NAME/> Deal\u000aPolitics: Insisting on her agency's independence, <NAME/> Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her.\u000aSACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President <NAME/> Lynch gave Gov. Gray <NAME/> help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.\u000a\u000aWith the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California <NAME/> from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.\u000a\u000aAlthough <NAME/> appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.\u000a\u000aEven as she took the lead in forging an <NAME/> deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that <NAME/> and Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. <NAME/> condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."\u000a\u000a<NAME/> repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while <NAME/> was publicly opposed to a rate hike.\u000a\u000aSuch actions have made her perhaps <NAME/>' least favorite appointee.\u000a\u000aAnd yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is <NAME/>' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.\u000a\u000aFor months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, <NAME/> may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on <NAME/>' staff, as "nonexistent."\u000a\u000aBut floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and <NAME/> aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the <NAME/> aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."\u000a\u000aA Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San <NAME/> before joining the administration, Lynch worked on <NAME/>' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.\u000a\u000aLynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.\u000a\u000aShe recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. <NAME/> Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing."\u000a\u000a"Before, I was on [<NAME/>'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."\u000a\u000aCritics, including many in the <NAME/> administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.\u000a\u000aInsisting on Independence\u000a\u000aAccounts of how the <NAME/> deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.\u000a\u000aStarting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of <NAME/>, <NAME/> and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. <NAME/> had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.\u000a\u000aLynch was another skeptic; <NAME/>' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate <NAME/>. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/> (D-San <NAME/>), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any <NAME/> bill.\u000a\u000aThe governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.\u000a\u000aLynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that <NAME/> had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure <NAME/>'s debt without the bells and whistles proposed by <NAME/> and other lawmakers.\u000a\u000aIt was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.\u000a\u000a"When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that <NAME/> might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.\u000a\u000aAt her direction, PUC General Counsel <NAME/> Cohen made the initial call to <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, PUC Started Secret Talks\u000a\u000a<NAME/> executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.\u000a\u000aBut with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San <NAME/> offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.\u000a\u000aThe PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."\u000a\u000aLynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to <NAME/>'s problem.\u000a\u000aLynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner <NAME/> Brown, one of three <NAME/> appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a"If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."\u000a\u000aFor several days, however, Lynch did not inform <NAME/>. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.\u000a\u000aOn Sept. 25, some of <NAME/>' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.\u000a\u000aThat same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to <NAME/> that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.\u000a\u000aOver the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.\u000a\u000a"It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney <NAME/> Olson, an <NAME/> board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.\u000a\u000aWhile those negotiations were going on, <NAME/> was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.\u000a\u000aThe issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by <NAME/> and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the <NAME/> administration struck with independent power producers.\u000a\u000aLynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.\u000a\u000aThe PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\u000a\u000aKnowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners <NAME/> Bilas and <NAME/> Duque.\u000a\u000aThe governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.\u000a\u000aBut his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aCommissioners Praise Lynch\u000a\u000aIn Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.\u000a\u000a"There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.\u000a\u000aBrown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.\u000a\u000a"She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of <NAME/>' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if <NAME/> decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.\u000a\u000a"I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCraver will head up any of these specific deals that <NAME/> enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  <NAME/> is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to <NAME/>, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything <NAME/> does over the next 24 months or so.  \u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aNice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:\u000a\u000a1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.\u000a2) In place of the <NAME/> quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."\u000a\u000aFinally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGreetings:\u000a\u000aFirst, thanks for the pizza.  \u000a\u000aSecond, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHere is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					\u000a\u000aThe Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.\u000aThe Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.\u000a\u000aThe Legislature's options: \u000a1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.\u000a2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.\u000a3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.\u000a\u000aIn short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.\u000a\u000aWhere to from here?\u000aThrough its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to <NAME/> that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an <NAME/> bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.\u000aJust before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out <NAME/>.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  \u000aGiven the Senate's view, and the open hositility between <NAME/> and <NAME/>, <NAME/>' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the <NAME/>' <NAME/> bill.  It is unclear at this time whether <NAME/> would play it that tough.\u000aWith the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.\u000aFinally, <NAME/> held a news conference this morning at which he said:\u000a<NAME/> and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."\u000aHe doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."\u000aWith all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail <NAME/> out and not the others.\u000a\u000aIf all this sounds ridiculous, it is.\u000a\u000aWe'll report back with additional information as we get it.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe Senate Rules Committee just met.  During the hearing, Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/> stated that:\u000athe Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78).\u000athe version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to <NAME/> and <NAME/>, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night.\u000aIf the Senate proceeds as <NAME/> suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get <NAME/>' signature.\u000a<NAME/> generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, <NAME/>'s comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.\u000aFinally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.

aV\u000a\u000aI'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to <NAME/> on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. <NAME/> seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.\u000a\u000aAs you know, having gone through <NAME/>, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in <NAME/>'s---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, <NAME/> in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.\u000a\u000aThese are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with <NAME/> and <NAME/> to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  \u000a\u000aI care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if <NAME/> is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and <NAME/> to discuss, if you think that would be useful.\u000a\u000aForgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with <NAME/>, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.\u000a\u000aTalk to you at noon your time.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet\u000aLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California <NAME/> expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the <NAME/> International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said <NAME/> <NAME/>, chairman and chief executive of <NAME/> International. \u000a"We intend to pay all of our creditors," <NAME/> said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." \u000aSouthern California <NAME/> and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. \u000aBoth parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California <NAME/> filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. \u000aThe settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. \u000a<NAME/> indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. \u000a"There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," <NAME/> said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." \u000a<NAME/> Craver, <NAME/>'s chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. \u000a<NAME/> said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." \u000a"We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," <NAME/> said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." \u000a<NAME/> added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate. \u000a     \u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>, president of Southern California <NAME/>, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. \u000a<NAME/> said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California <NAME/>'s debt. \u000aThe utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. \u000a"In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But <NAME/> said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. \u000aThe utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. \u000a<NAME/> said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC. \u000a     \u000aFearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria <NAME/> after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray <NAME/> and <NAME/> executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. \u000aThe negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, <NAME/> aides and <NAME/> executives said. \u000aThe end result, <NAME/> and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California <NAME/> from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi Evie:\u000aAs you know <NAME/> is being, well, <NAME/> about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (<NAME/> Botorff and <NAME/> <NAME/>) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing\u000a \u000aThe (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around <NAME/>, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.\u000a \u000aAt the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.\u000a \u000aI hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around <NAME/>.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  <NAME/> <NAME/> Kahl be at DJ's meeting?\u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIn what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down <NAME/>' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.\u000aThe vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with <NAME/>' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.\u000a<NAME/>' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another <NAME/> appointee--<NAME/> Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve <NAME/>' proposed rate agreement.\u000a\u000aWhat is <NAME/>' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?\u000aIt would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.\u000aIt would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.\u000a\u000aWhat are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject <NAME/>' proposal?\u000aWith the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.\u000aThe political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.\u000aIt remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.\u000aUnder the structure devised by <NAME/>, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.\u000aIn short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.\u000aSafe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed <NAME/>, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.\u000a\u000aWhat Next?\u000aA broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.\u000aThe bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.\u000aProponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.\u000aThe bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.\u000aAll four PUC commissioners who voted against the <NAME/> rate agreement today urged <NAME/> to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get <NAME/> to sign it.\u000a<NAME/> has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.\u000aGiven today's vote, however, <NAME/> may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.\u000a\u000aUpdate on <NAME/> Bailout\u000aStill appears that chances are very small that <NAME/> and <NAME/> will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an <NAME/> bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.\u000a\u000aIf you have any questions, just let us know.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aState's Electric <NAME/> Gets Lighter\u000a\u000a\u000aEnergy: <NAME/> and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.\u000a\u000aBy MIGUEL BUSTILLO\u000aTimes Staff Writer\u000a\u000aOctober 20 2001\u000a\u000aSACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the <NAME/> administration said Friday. \u000a\u000aEven so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. \u000a\u000aThe discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray <NAME/> and Public Utilities Commission President <NAME/> Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. \u000a\u000aSpecifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. \u000a\u000aLynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts. \u000a\u000aCalifornia has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San <NAME/> Gas & Electric and Southern California <NAME/>, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. \u000a\u000aIn August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. \u000a\u000aBut in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," <NAME/> administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs. \u000a\u000aBig Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers\u000a\u000aThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. \u000a\u000aHowever, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers. \u000a\u000a"Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said <NAME/> Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers." \u000a\u000aState Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. \u000a\u000a"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said. \u000a\u000aAnd consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. \u000a\u000a"The PUC first gave <NAME/> their bailout," said <NAME/> Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place." \u000a\u000aBut Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. \u000a\u000aLynch accused Angelides and the <NAME/> administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. \u000a\u000aThe real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. \u000a\u000a"If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts." \u000a\u000aAlso adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates. \u000a\u000aThe loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. \u000a\u000a<NAME/> and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy\u000a\u000aIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. \u000a\u000aIf the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. \u000a\u000aIn another action that could reduce rates, <NAME/> administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. \u000a\u000aBut <NAME/> advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. \u000a\u000a"I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said <NAME/> Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.\u000a

Gray <NAME/> said he was heartened by the judge's belief that California is due some amount of refund money, rejecting the generators' arguments for no refunds.\u000aWith the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power traders had offered up $716 million in proposed refunds in the final days. But Wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state still owes power companies, meaning no cash would actually change hands.\u000aThe judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp., could reach separate agreements with the state.\u000a"From what I know, it looks like we can reach an agreement," Calpine spokesman <NAME/> Highlander confirmed Monday. But he said he could not disclose any details under Wagner's gag order on participants in the negotiations.\u000a<NAME/> Corp., one of the nation's highest-profile power traders, said California officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the state's consumers deserved at least $8.9 billion in refunds for overcharges.\u000a"These talks never had a chance," said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/>. "Their political skins are worth more than $716 million that the taxpayers of California could have used. It was about creating and maintaining a tool for a witch hunt."\u000aOf the $716 million compromise offer, $510 million was put on the table by what Wagner called the "Big Five" generators -- Reliant, <NAME/>, Mirant, <NAME/> and Dynegy -- some of whom are under state investigation. Another $125 million was offered by BC Hydro, British Colombia's government utility, which is not under FERC jurisdiction, and $16.5 million was offered by six California municipal utilities.\u000aThe Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the state's second-largest municipal utility, also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amount it may have offered, but said it would outline its position in writing Thursday, the judge's deadline for comments on his proposal.\u000aConsumer advocates and some industry officials said the judge's brief public remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on the state's troubled electric scene.\u000a"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's outrageous," said <NAME/> Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. "If they're going to start doing some fact finding, hallelujah."\u000aHoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start, because there was no effort by FERC to determine how high the overcharges had actually been and then work toward a compromise from there.\u000aThe state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator, the Independent System Operator, which was attacked by marketers as wildly high even while the state called it conservatively low.\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>, representing all five of the big generators, said Monday that the ISO has consistently based its demand on "sketchy and incomplete" data.\u000aThe face-off between <NAME/> and power merchants began last fall, as wholesale electricity costs were soaring and California utilities warned that they could be driven into bankruptcy.\u000aThe governor said generators and traders took advantage of the state's power shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers. Generators said they followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situation.\u000aFERC, which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electricity rates are "just and reasonable," has made repeated, unsuccessful efforts to craft a solution that could appease both sides.\u000aState Assembly Speaker <NAME/> Hertzberg, D-<NAME/> Oaks, said Monday that the failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure "comes as no surprise."\u000aNegotiators representing generators "refused to even acknowledge the inescapable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional market -- at California's expense," he said.\u000a<NAME/>, who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith with state representatives, said that although FERC commissioners have been slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesale electricity, they "now have the opportunity to redeem themselves."\u000aHe suggested the commissioners can opt to award California more than is recommended by the judge.\u000aWagner, after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend, seemed resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government, utility and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futility.\u000a<NAME/> Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the California ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well.\u000a"We came here wanting $8.9 billion," Kahn said. "In all candor, we didn't receive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped they would be. But our positions were vindicated" because refunds were offered.\u000aMeanwhile, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California <NAME/> sounded the call for more talks.\u000a"We're willing to talk to anyone, anytime about a settlement," said <NAME/> Pickett, general counsel of Southern California <NAME/>. PG&E said in a prepared statement that the sessions "provide a solid basis for further negotiations."\u000aHow much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question mark. Wagner said settlement offers of $716 million suggest that eventual refunds will amount to "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion." But he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to FERC commissioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be.\u000aOther recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a mixed bag for the state.\u000aThe judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than Oct. 2, 2000, an action that Kahn said would immediately slice $3 billion off the state's refund analysis that stretched back to May 2000.\u000aBut Kahn said that was no defeat for the state, which would turn to the courts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order.\u000a"We still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder," Kahn said.\u000a<NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel of <NAME/> Energy of North America, said he felt the formula laid out by Wagner would generate a refund order in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion.\u000a"It's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks," Bailey said.\u000a\u000aThe Bee's <NAME/> Whitney can be reached at (202) 383-0004 or dwhitney@mcclatchydc.com .\u000aStaff writers <NAME/> Bazar and Dale Kasler contributed to this report.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThird power plant opens: But the Los Medanos facility isn't pouring out electricity yet.\u000aBy <NAME/> Peyton\u000aBee Staff Writer\u000a(Published July 10, 2001)\u000aThe flood of new electricity being welcomed by Gov. Gray <NAME/> was only a trickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on Monday, according to sources close to California's energy crisis.\u000aHeralded by <NAME/> as part of a "powerful one-two-three punch" that will bring California closer to energy independence, the Los Medanos Energy Center in Pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day, they said.\u000aThat is less than 5 percent of the plant's 555-megawatt operating capacity.\u000aLos Medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week but is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks, according to knowledgable sources.\u000aRepresentatives for Calpine and the governor's office, when pressed for details, acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said they did not know how much electricity was actually produced Monday.\u000aCalpine, which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from Los Medanos, is keeping track of the production but the figure wasn't immediately available for the media, spokeswoman <NAME/> Potter said.\u000a"Even if it was two megawatts, that's two more megawatts that we didn't have yesterday," said <NAME/> spokesman <NAME/> Maviglio.\u000aHe said the opening was "largely ceremonial," timed for the convenience of the governor and Calpine's top executive.\u000aBut consumer advocate <NAME/> Rosenfield called the media event "a deception." It was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has attended in the past two weeks.\u000a"It's the governor trying to convince people he's hard at work solving the problem when it's all for show," Rosenfield said. "He's governing by sound bite. He's certainly getting his money's worth from the consultants he hired."\u000a<NAME/> political adviser <NAME/> South said last week that the governor's new radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in California.\u000a"Generation comes up in our polls as being the No. 1 thing people want us to do -- build more power plants," South said then. "People want the sense that progress is being made -- that this is not spiraling out of control."\u000aThe other two plants that <NAME/> kicked off -- Sunrise in Kern County and Sutter near Yuba City -- have since been running at maximum capacity.\u000aCalpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of Los Medanos within a week to 10 days, company officials said.\u000a"In the first month of these new plants, there are always stops and starts," said Calpine spokesman <NAME/> Highlander. "Sometimes we shut down altogether."\u000aIncluding the three just-opened facilities, new or expanded power plants are expected to add 1,500 megawatts to the state's struggling electric grid by the end of July, and 870 megawatts of that is already in place, according to the state Independent System Operator.\u000aAnother 1,000 megawatts is anticipated for the end of August and 1,100 more for the end of September, under a rough timetable that is likely to see some plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind.\u000a\u000aThe Bee's <NAME/> Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or cpeyton@sacbee.com .\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aState reveals high-priced power deals\u000aBy Dale Kasler and <NAME/> Bowman\u000aBee Staff Writers\u000a(Published July 10, 2001)\u000aThe state Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity on the spot market, revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wildly within minutes.\u000aThe Department of Water Resources, which has been criticized for keeping its power-purchasing practices a secret, released 1,770 pages of invoices and trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purchases since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan. 17. The information was released a week after state Controller <NAME/> Connell put out details of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gray <NAME/>, her political nemesis.\u000aThe state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of California's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising questions from lawmakers and others about <NAME/>' policies for resolving the state's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.\u000aWhen it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largely because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their dependence on spot sales.\u000a"Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum," said <NAME/> Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.\u000aThe information released Monday covered the first three months of the year and didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for electricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas generator that owns several plants in the state. <NAME/> Energy Corp. of North <NAME/> charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but that sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's transmission grid.\u000aThe documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy power for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.\u000aThrough May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent of San <NAME/> Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energy Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., about $23.7 million.\u000aAmong others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 million through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; Atlanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville Power Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District $80.7 million.\u000aGenerally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the prices. For instance, Oklahoma-based generator <NAME/> Cos. commanded $565 a megawatt-hour March 20, when blackouts struck more than 1 million Californians.\u000aLocation also was critical. On March 8 the state paid the PG&E trading unit $250 but only $180 to Arizona-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. The difference was that PG&E's power was delivered to energy-starved Northern California, while Pinnacle's was sent to Southern California where energy wasn't so scarce.\u000aSplit-second timing was also crucial. At 9:09 a.m. Feb. 14, the state paid $400 to Mirant for power to be delivered the next day. By 10 a.m. it was paying Mieco Inc., a Long Beach trading firm, $475 for the same product.\u000a"That's the spot market -- it's the most volatile market in the world, and it changes on a second-by-second basis," said <NAME/> Corp. spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000aFor all the criticism leveled at <NAME/>, Reliant and other big corporations, government-owned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high prices.\u000aBC Hydro, the electric utility owned by the Canadian province of British Columbia, submitted bills for up to $1,000 a megawatt-hour. The city of Glendale charged $375 a megawatt-hour for power in January, while SMUD charged $309 a megawatt-hour in March. The city of <NAME/>, Ore., averaged $450 a megawatt-hour in February.\u000a"We play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace," said BC Hydro spokesman <NAME/> Cousins. "Our traders worked very hard to find additional sources of electricity to keep the lights on in California. Had we not come through and stepped forward with these supplies, the consequences to California customers would have been severe."\u000aThe state also said it has spent $14.4 million on administrative costs in buying power.\u000a\u000aThe Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.com .\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGovernment finds ways to conserve: The Santa <NAME/> Jail goes solar as agencies get creative to cut costs.\u000aBy <NAME/> Miller\u000aBee Correspondent\u000a(Published July 10, 2001)\u000aTo <NAME/> Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa <NAME/> Jail in Dublin aren't just energy-makers; they're money in the bank.\u000aWhen all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the United States -- will cut the jail's demand on the electric grid by up to 20 percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.\u000aThat sun power, combined with conservation projects already completed at the jail, will slash about $300,000 a year from the facility's energy bill. Muniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.\u000a"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a business decision, just investing your money," said Muniz. "There's virtually no maintenance on this equipment. It just sits on your roof and converts right into electricity that you're using as soon as you generate it. I think (solar) is the wave of the future, even though it's been around 30 or 40 years."\u000aThe Santa <NAME/> Jail project is among the largest, and perhaps most conspicuous, examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity use in response to skyrocketing power bills and Gov. Gray <NAME/>' call for public entities to conserve.\u000aAmong the examples:\u000aSan <NAME/> leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solar-powered rooftop projects around the city.\u000aThe Tulare County town of Lindsay will open City Hall two hours earlier -- at 6 a.m.-- and close at 4:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday this summer so offices can stay dark all day Friday and during peak-use afternoon hours.\u000aSacramento County has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can better withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees. Workers have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps operate during low demand.\u000a"When you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns from some citizens, that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help out," said Jolena Voorhis, an energy analyst at the California State Association of Counties. "Certainly (counties) stepped up to the plate when they were asked to increase conservation efforts. They've done about as much as humanly possible."\u000aKings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signed up for Southern California <NAME/>'s interruptible load program, which promises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrical services in times of shortage.\u000aThen California's power crisis hit full-force this year. Since January, <NAME/> has called on the Central Valley county to cut electricity at its Hanford government center 16 times -- for up to six hours each cycle.\u000aAt times that meant no lights to greet the public, no computers to process food stamp requests and during the Valley's foggy winter days, no heat to warm many of the 1,200 employees.\u000a"We had one week in January when we were virtually shut down," said Chief Administrative Officer <NAME/> Spikes. "We just decided we couldn't function that way."\u000aSo Kings County supervisors bought a $550,000 diesel-powered generator to match those already at the jail and juvenile center. They also decided to open and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildings can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 p.m.\u000aThe new hours, dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business these days, Spikes said.\u000aSo far, most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years, Voorhis said.\u000aPublic agencies' power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses.\u000aRevenues at PowerLight, the Berkeley company that installed the Santa <NAME/> Jail photovoltaic system, have tripled since last year.\u000a"The last six months have been particularly intense," said <NAME/> Lin, director of business development for PowerLight. "In some ways the energy crisis in California has been a call to action."\u000aThe Sacramento Municipal Utility District, which already boasts the largest photovoltaic program in the country, has a 2,000-customer waiting list for solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state Capitol, said <NAME/> Osborn, SMUD's solar program manager.\u000aBack in Dublin, the 3,600 inmates at the Santa <NAME/> Jail still receive three meals, air conditioning and hot showers -- powered now, in part, by the plentiful sun in this relatively fog-free part of the East Bay.\u000aThe $4 million project, financed entirely with state and utility subsidies, should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade, Muniz said.\u000a"It's a good investment for the money we're putting up front," he said.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a   Energy talks reach no settlement; state threatens suit        By <NAME/> <NAME/> ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the state and power generators stalled, California may go to court to help win the $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity.  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less," said <NAME/> Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray <NAME/>.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in refunds.    "The numbers were too far apart," said <NAME/> Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power companies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said <NAME/> Heller, spokesman for the Santa <NAME/>-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  <NAME/> Bailey, general counsel for <NAME/> Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year before. <NAME/> has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - <NAME/> Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the <NAME/> Cos. - said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, said <NAME/> H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees possibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert  COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collapsed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal regulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 billion in refunds.  "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," <NAME/> L. Wagner Jr., chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previewing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums for electricity "that probably are higher than any overcharges" for which they may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California could see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the power generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and utilities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he said FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintain that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  "I would suspect that would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," said Joe Ronan, vice president of Calpine, a San <NAME/>-based electricity generator. "I think (Wagner's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened" in the state's dysfunctional power market.  But <NAME/> Kahn, the state's lead negotiator, said Wagner "vindicated" California's core arguments.  "The hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected," said Kahn, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power grid.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its $8.9 billion."  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their conduct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position.  During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhere near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers had put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  "That's a long way from splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, you can't work miracles."  Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will between the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the previously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  <NAME/> H. Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund demand. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot back that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approached the state.  Figures scrutinized "This is the first time we've heard any of this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been cooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading," Kahn said.  The state's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid operator of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have been if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he said that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, and should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calculated.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rather than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Those and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of overcharges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to October would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  <NAME/> Bailey, vice president and general counsel for <NAME/> Energy North America, said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast improvement over FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's) model."

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray <NAME/>' standing plummets \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a(Published Oct. 7, 2001) \u000a\u000aA year ago, Gray <NAME/> was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. \u000a\u000aToday, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. \u000a\u000aThe seriousness of <NAME/>' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor <NAME/> Riordan to <NAME/>. History indicates that <NAME/> should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating <NAME/>. \u000a\u000a<NAME/>' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and <NAME/> will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. \u000a\u000aHow big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that <NAME/>' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor <NAME/> <NAME/> confronted in 1991. <NAME/> swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. \u000a\u000aHowever large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money <NAME/> spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. \u000a\u000aIt's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why <NAME/>' own appointees to the PUC are balking. <NAME/> could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But <NAME/> is insisting that he'll veto the measure. \u000a\u000aThe effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as <NAME/>' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California <NAME/>, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned. \u000a\u000a  _____  \u000a\u000aThe Bee's <NAME/> Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>.\u000a

Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the <NAME/> MOU.  \u000a\u000aWord on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from <NAME/> & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.\u000a\u000aThe idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing <NAME/> will have left is 18XX.  \u000a\u000aWe'll report back with news as we get it.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> devises new borrowing plan \u000aHis executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. \u000aSACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray <NAME/> is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. \u000aThe plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged <NAME/> last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. \u000aWith enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. \u000a"That is one scenario," <NAME/> spokeswoman <NAME/> McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." \u000aMost involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. \u000a<NAME/> wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. \u000aThe PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the <NAME/>-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. \u000aThe PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the <NAME/> plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, <NAME/> appointee <NAME/> Lynch. \u000a<NAME/> earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. \u000aThe plan now under review, however, would bypass that. \u000aThe DWR would not directly set rates, but under the <NAME/> plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. \u000aThe administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. \u000aLynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether <NAME/> had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. \u000a"I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." \u000aThe governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader <NAME/> <NAME/>, D-San <NAME/>. \u000a<NAME/> opposes <NAME/>'s bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which <NAME/> believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. \u000aIf <NAME/> signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aState lowers estimate of energy costs \u000aConsumers might see rates decrease \u000a<NAME/> Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau <mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com>\u000aSaturday, October 20, 2001 \u000a?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle \u000a\u000aURL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL>\u000a\u000aSacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. \u000a\u000aOfficials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. \u000a\u000aThe agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. \u000a\u000a"Circumstances have changed," said <NAME/> Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market." \u000a\u000aEarlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, \u000a\u000aand Gov. Gray <NAME/>' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. \u000a\u000aBut the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. \u000a\u000aIt is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. \u000a\u000aAt the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. \u000a\u000aAdministration officials and state Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. \u000a\u000aThe PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. \u000a\u000a"What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. \u000a\u000aHe urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. \u000a\u000aBut Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. \u000a\u000aShe also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports <NAME/> Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000aCONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY \u000aPace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed \u000aQuite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. \u000aInstead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. \u000aChairman <NAME/> stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. \u000a<NAME/> indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. \u000aWith the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? \u000aKellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman <NAME/> and <NAME/> Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. \u000aFlukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. \u000aPower Authority Names <NAME/> <NAME/> as Chief Financial Officer \u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. <NAME/> currently works for the City of San <NAME/>, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.\u000a

The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray <NAME/>, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.\u000aThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by <NAME/> Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.\u000aThe letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting.\u000a"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures."\u000aISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC\u000aThe ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from.\u000aIf the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said.\u000a"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated."\u000aThe ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first.\u000a"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. <NAME/> from political embarrassment," the second letter says.\u000aThe ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting.\u000aGenerators Confused\u000aGenerators, including Mirant Corp.

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-of-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see.\u000aDWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief <NAME/> Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts.\u000aThe out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months.\u000aNone of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.\u000aThe meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public.\u000aThe meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market.\u000a"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices," Wolfman said in the letter.\u000a-By <NAME/> Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com <mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aApologies, don't know how in the heck I missed you on the list.  (You know just clawing and backstabbing my way to the top.)   Anywho, here's the note that I just sent.  Let me know if there's anyone else that I embarassingly missed.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIn California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.  Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.  There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.\u000a\u000aIf there's anything else, let me know.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe writer fails of course to mention that <NAME/> (with bi-partisan support) bombed the shit out of bin laden after the embassy attacks.  Frankly, I find any partisan activity at this juncture to be petty and deplorable.  There's a heckuvalot of people that just watched a couple of jumbo jets fly into the WTC, and a whole bunch of people without families anymore.  There's no room for politics in my view, period.  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that  the families of the victims are thinking about at this time. \u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a \u000aWe'll see you tonite for the bluegrass filming?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIf you're referring to the Tues/Thur call, we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with Sacramento folks having the option of callling in, since the Legislature's gone until January. You have thoughts on the Monday call?  That one may not be as critical anymore.\u000a \u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p9098
aV\u000a\u000aApologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion, but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with <NAME/> and <NAME/>.

aV\u000a\u000aOne other thing.  I just had coffee with a former business colleague.  She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).  I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t. setting up board, staff, etc.  She's very interested. She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aHere is the final.  Couple things.  The short answers are in the word document.  The long answers  are in two separate excel files.  I used the spreadsheet that you gave us to do the last long answer (the <NAME/> <NAME/> question).  You can find the answer in a tab titled "Long Answer--Question IIb" and it's highlighted by yellow background.  The data for the problem is in the "data" tab.\u000a\u000aThanks again for a fantastic course and hope to run into you in the near future.\u000a\u000aAll the best,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

And I bet she would feel the same way.  All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.  It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for <NAME/>, and everyone else, is for <NAME/> to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.

aV\u000a\u000afyi.\u000a\u000aExtraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures\u000aCall of Special Session: \u000aOnly the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. \u000aElection of Special Session Officers, Committees and <NAME/> Referrals: \u000aThe election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. \u000aIdentification of Special Session Bills and Publications: \u000aSeparate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. \u000aIntroduction of Special Session Bills: \u000aThere is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. \u000aSpecial Session <NAME/> Procedures and Calendars: \u000aThere is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. \u000aEffective Date of Special Session Legislation: \u000aSimple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. \u000aEnd of Special Session: \u000aOnly the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGreetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that <NAME/> Wood and <NAME/> Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  <NAME/>, talked to <NAME/> yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.\u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFYI.\u000a\u000aNevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts \u000aLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. \u000aThe contracts would force <NAME/> Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities <NAME/> Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said <NAME/> Soderberg, PUC chairman. \u000a"We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. \u000aNo one at <NAME/> Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. \u000aThe PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. <NAME/> Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. \u000aThe General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. \u000a<NAME/> Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. <NAME/> Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. \u000aCalifornia 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.\u000a
p9148
aV\u000a\u000aPlease forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:\u000a\u000aThe Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.\u000aWith minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  \u000aThe utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.\u000aA large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.\u000aThere were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.\u000aThe next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.\u000aThe judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.\u000aIn sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.\u000aAt this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.\u000aOf particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)\u000aThe judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).\u000aOur attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  \u000aThough the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.\u000aInterestingly, <NAME/> made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for <NAME/>'s undercollection.  \u000aThe judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  \u000aAs a result, <NAME/> didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.\u000aThe judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.\u000aFrom today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  \u000aIn related news, <NAME/> has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."\u000a
p9149
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000aHere are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).

aV\u000a\u000aPG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif \u000aSAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. \u000aCritics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. \u000a<NAME/> Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. \u000aThe reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. \u000aThe utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. \u000aThe plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said <NAME/> <NAME/>, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. \u000aIt would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. \u000aEYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM \u000aOne of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. \u000aElected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San <NAME/> federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. \u000aThe Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president <NAME/> Lujan told Reuters. \u000aPG&E spokesman <NAME/> <NAME/> said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \u000aThe utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. \u000aBut State Attorney General <NAME/> Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. \u000aLockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. \u000aDespite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel <NAME/> Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. \u000a'FIRE SALE PRICES' \u000a"PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. \u000a"PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said <NAME/> Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \u000aPG&E's <NAME/> said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. \u000a<NAME/> said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. \u000aPG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. \u000aThe CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. \u000aThey point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. \u000aThe PG&E utility and <NAME/> International's Southern California <NAME/> utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. \u000aSoCal <NAME/> and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to <NAME/> last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on <NAME/> and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.\u000a\u000aThe concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  \u000a\u000aTo her credit, <NAME/> refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.\u000a\u000aIn light of these events (and the increasing attacks on <NAME/> by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give <NAME/> an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:\u000a\u000aAngelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis.\u000aRe-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.\u000a\u000aFolks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  \u000a\u000aA letter might be useful in order to 1) give <NAME/> some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.\u000a\u000aAny thoughts?  \u000a\u000aBest,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aCommissioners <NAME/> M. Duque and <NAME/> A. Bilas, dissenting:\u000a\u000aOne could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.\u000a\u000aWe are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. \u000a\u000aSomething else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. \u000a\u000a	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  \u000a\u000a	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. \u000a\u000aFor these reasons we must respectfully dissent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a/s/ HENRY M.

aV\u000a\u000aUSA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.\u000a\u000a07/06/2001\u000aReuters English News Service\u000a(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\u000a\u000a(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) \u000aSAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold.\u000aCalpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. \u000aAs part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. \u000aCalpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. \u000aThe move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. \u000aUnder the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. \u000aThe contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. \u000a"Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president <NAME/> Macias said in a statement.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aHere's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.\u000a\u000aOn the plus side:\u000aHe is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills.\u000aHe sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the "MOU" for <NAME/> that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU.\u000aHis decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political "center of gravity"--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.\u000a\u000aOn the negative side: \u000aIn each and every case that <NAME/> has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first.\u000aHere are three examples (and there are more):  \u000a1) 	During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a "stranded cost charge" for utilities. 	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill.\u000a2)	In the "alternative MOU" that <NAME/> worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that <NAME/> insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with <NAME/>.\u000a3)	<NAME/> sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and <NAME/> remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> this helps.

DWR projects that its funds on hand at the date of this Official Statement and projected revenues appear to be sufficient to finance the Power Supply Program. The cash needs of the Power Supply Program depend, among other things, on future power purchase costs, the timing and amount of revenues from power sales, the availability of additional interim loans, and the timing of the issuance of revenue bonds by DWR. The Power Supply Act limits loans and advances from the State under the Power Supply Act after November 15, 2001, to amounts required for short-term cash flow purposes of no more than $500 million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days. However, the Governor has the power under the Emergency Services Act to order additional loans or other advances to DWR if needed to further mitigate the emergency.\u000a\u000a	The State expects to maintain adequate cash reserves to fund its normal operations during the 2001-02 fiscal year whether or not DWR repays the State loans during the fiscal year.

We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  \u000a\u000a	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.\u000a\u000aHere are some of the program's highlights:\u000a\u000aEnabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.\u000a\u000aOur alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name. \u000a\u000aOur market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities\u000a\u000aOur alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.\u000a\u000aProducts and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.\u000a\u000aInnovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses. \u000a\u000a	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.\u000a\u000aAll the best,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

LLGM should participate on this call and gather all other information available(Mirant and Reliant legal memos) and lets talk sometime next week.

p9290
aV\u000a\u000aIs there any way that we can move this to 3? I have a meeting from 1:30-2:30. Or just move it back 30 min.\u000a

p9300
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>- I think that <NAME/> Haedicke talked to <NAME/> about this but I wanted to follow up. We want to make sure that <NAME/> is available to <NAME/> as well and that his representation of Idaho Power does not infringe on work we might want him to do.\u000a
p9301

p9323
aV\u000a\u000aI tried for 10 minutes to sign up before giving up. This has to be easier. It seems to me that someone at HR doesn't get it.\u000a
p9324
aV\u000a\u000aThe issue of the SCE bankruptcy will come up again. <NAME/>-- did you ever talk to Reliant or Mirant? The next call that you have re the PG&E bankruptcy, I would like  to join in and dicuss the issue of an involuntary filing. I know we have talked about it before, but because of the hijackers, we never got the full legal analysis. <NAME/> Laria at White and Case and the McCutchen attys had done some research. They offered to provide it to us. Lets take a look, do our own research, and discuss.\u000a
p9325
aV\u000a\u000aFyi. I told her not to go because we had too many other problems. I do need to develope a plan to deal with FCPA. I would like to mninmize her involvement, but fear this will upset <NAME/> and Walls. Any suggestions?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000amtouhey@velaw.com\u000a
p9327
aV\u000a\u000aKnox thinks any settlement will be between 1-2 million,probably closer to 2. What business person, if any, should we talk to about this? With Carrin, <NAME/> M. and Knox, the attys fees will be enormous if this case ever gets going again.\u000a

p9331
aV\u000a\u000aOnly if you say I have to.\u000a
p9332
aV\u000a\u000aAs you will recall, <NAME/> was referred to us by <NAME/> Manne and served as local counsel in the Glatzer matter. He has done a great job. Although I don't have anything now, I would love to send something his way.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is ok. Lets review them in the SF <NAME/> office.\u000a
p9340
aV\u000a\u000aThe problem with tapping those funds is that the hogs will get fatter. I think we should vote with our overall theme in mind: the PX participants committee is out of control and anything that curtails them is good.  Is that clear as mud?\u000a
p9341
aV\u000a\u000aTracy-- can you look at this and give me a call-35587. I dont understand what it means to us.\u000a

V\u000a\u000ano.  i got her number though.  i want to hook up with that girl paige in the brown leather jacket.  what happened to you?  i had a blast that night.\u000a
p9351
aV\u000a\u000ai won't be a waiter for more than a year.  it takes time.  it isn't like i will change my profession to a waiter.  it will just be something to pay the bills.  i don't know why it is so hard for you to understand that.  i haven't heard about my house.\u000a
p9352
aV\u000a\u000ai felt fine.  i was just tired but i didn't feel bad.  my golf game sucks but that is b/c i have a new golf swing after my lesson a couple of weeks ago.  this swing is going to take me  to the next level.  i think if trading doesn't work out i will have something to fall back on.\u000a
p9353
aV\u000a\u000ar&r was fun.  we went downtown first and it sucked.  i felt like i was in kabul w/ all of al queda.  r&r was packed though.  i didn't get there until around 1am.  when are you going home?\u000a
p9354
aV\u000a\u000ayou didn't send the number.  just call me on mine @ 7138258410.  i am thinking tealas and sitting out on the porch.\u000a
p9355
aV\u000a\u000aok.  what are you guys doing for halloween?  boone was thinking about having a party to watch the lsu game and then go out to r&r.  i guess there is some halloween thing there.  let me knwow what is going on and we can see what is up for later.\u000a
p9356
aV\u000a\u000athanks for including me.  i don't think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period.  i have to go to miami and party on south beach.  sorry.  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing (feb-mar)  i could definately go.  robicheaux is bald?  i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him.  i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it.  i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed.\u000a
p9357
aV\u000a\u000ait was ok.  we went to the lsu game and lsu lost so we came home that night.  what did you do this weekend?\u000a
p9358
aV\u000a\u000ait is tough to watch because they cant stop shit.  i need to email the paper and complain in this article.\u000a
p9359
aV\u000a\u000athe assets are marked up and we cant sell them.  the problem is that we have tapped out our credit lines and we need another $2 billion.  seems like we are racing against the clock.\u000a
p9360
aV\u000a\u000ai don't know.  i am going to golf sunday morning at the woodlands which is very nice.  i don't want to be real hung over, but i still might go out.  tonight i am definately going out.\u000a
p9361
aV\u000a\u000asorry i haven't called you back.  i am in portland.  i don't get back until tonight.  i will call you when i get home.  hope all is well.\u000a
p9362
aV\u000a\u000amemorial all packed up.  we can go out there and just try to get on.  hopefully around 2:30.  maybe you can get out early and get our names on.\u000a
p9363
aV\u000a\u000ai am going to stay here.  i am going to the ut/a&m game on fri.  i am just looking forward to hanging out and relaxing.  i need to get some sleep, relax and get my mind off of enron.  seems like it is day to day on whether or not we are going out of business.  it is wearing on me.\u000a
p9364
aV\u000a\u000ayeah baby.  i was there two weeks ago and there were hotties everywhere.  i am going to come home in the early part of july and we will figure out the final details.\u000a
p9365
aV\u000a\u000ayour last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english.  i was wondering why you didn't respond.  jury duty sucks huh?  have you been going out at all?\u000a
p9366
aV\u000a\u000asorry about that.  we were running so late and we couldn't find green.  we did turn south and drove around until 12:30 and figured we were too late.  i figured your phone died.  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit.  i was so dead from the night before.  i should have slept all day.  we can tee them up sometime soon.\u000a
p9367
aV\u000a\u000ai told him i didn't think you could make it on sat and that we were both out of town last weekend so we would head up the following sat.\u000a
p9368
aV\u000a\u000athanks for that email.  i just opened it and everyone say that shoot across all 4 screens of mine.  i will talk to you later b/c i have to go up to hr now.\u000a
p9369
aV\u000a\u000ai don't remember half of that night, but i do remember you in the bathroom.  sierra is fun on wednesdays isn't it?\u000a
p9370
aV\u000a\u000ai think that all they do is bark and freak out.  they aren't good dogs.  they aren't friendly.  and i am not angry.\u000a
p9371
aV\u000a\u000ayou think houston is the armpit of the world?  i love it hear.  the weather sucks in the summer, but other than that it is a blast.  so you do work for strip clubs huh?  that is interesting.  what is your stripper name?\u000a
p9372
aV\u000a\u000ai thought it was.  i think that girl is hot.  if i won $80million that is the girl i want you to hook up with.\u000a
p9373
aV\u000a\u000ai need to call that girl tonight.  you have got to give them a few days before you call.  i wanted to take her out thurs but the stanley cup is on.  maybe fri is better.  take your girl out then and we can meet up later for drinks.\u000a
p9374
aV\u000a\u000ahttp://www.bonniebernstein.freeservers.com/  \u000a\u000athis is the site and she doesn't look like a man.  danm it.\u000a
p9375
aV\u000a\u000ai went to grab some pizza, ate and then passed out.  those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge.  sorry about taking off like that.  i had a good time, but i ran out of energy quick.\u000a
p9376
aV\u000a\u000ai have a room reserved.  it is $160/night.  we can split it up and pay $40 each which is cheap.  i think it is around jan 12th.  i have the room from that thurs-sat.\u000a
p9377
aV\u000a\u000ai think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley.  i think he heads up the trading track program.  this is the best way to get into trading now.  you have to do 3 6mo. rotations in different trading support roles.  contact him and he should be able to get you more info.  hope that helps you out.\u000a
p9378
aV\u000a\u000afamous vassigh quotes:\u000a\u000a"pass the butter"\u000a"you gonna finish that?"\u000a"if loving this cake is wrong, i don't want to be right"\u000a"i can eat twice as much of this ice cream b/c it is fat free"\u000a"food in lousyana is overrated.  texas food rules"\u000a"texas biscuts rule the world"\u000a"i like my cookies texas size"\u000a"don't mess with texas banana splits"\u000a
p9379
aV\u000a\u000agood to hear from you.  looks like you got out at the right time.  ene is a sinking ship.  your boy fastow and skilling have sunk it.  are they making you work 100 hour weeks yet?\u000a
p9380
aV\u000a\u000ai dont think you look like her anymore.  my judgement was off that day.  i was around paint fumes looking at houses.\u000a
p9381
aV\u000a\u000ai know that when you get really mad at me it is only b/c you care..................so......................much\u000a
p9382
aV\u000a\u000asorry i didn't get back to you last night.  i was on the other line with paige.  i am so pumped about her.\u000a
p9383
aV\u000a\u000ado you want to send your resume to enron again?  they are on a big kick to hire some new people.  might be worth your while just to take a look and  see how it compares.\u000a
p9384
aV\u000a\u000athis is the group throwing the party at r&r sat night.  check some of the photos at the link at the bottom.  lots of hotties.\u000a

p9387
aV\u000a\u000ayeah.  i had it picked out and everything.  i had to call the dealer and tell him i am not going to suprise you with it.  we can still go to dinner tomorrow night though.\u000a
p9388
aV\u000a\u000ai tried to watch it but i couldn't stay awake.  it didn't start here until 9 and i have to get up at 5 so it is to hard to stay up.  how did they look?  st. louis has had a good rest so it should be interesting to watch them in that series.  i will watch the next series b/c it will probably be on tv at a normal time.\u000a
p9389
aV\u000a\u000ai booked my flight home on june 30th.  i arrive that afternoon and leave to houston on the 7th.  so have the frig packed with food and beer and be ready to golf.  looking foward to getting home.\u000a\u000alove matt\u000a

p9393
aV\u000a\u000ai think i can make it tonight but tomorrow night the hockey game is on.  i need the  range.  just send your resume when you get a chance.  enron is looking for a ton of people.\u000a
p9394
aV\u000a\u000ai just heard that before and tori was joking w/ me about that.  i don't get it.  are we starting our contest tonight?\u000a
p9395
aV\u000a\u000adoes miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to caymans and they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.  either place will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life.\u000a
p9396
aV\u000a\u000ai just looked at the prices for flights to cayman and they run around $600.  this is going to cost over $1000.  start saving now.\u000a
p9397
aV\u000a\u000ai thought you were going to say you thought of the witty comeback the next morning when you both woke up.\u000a

p9402
aV\u000a\u000awatched lsu and then went to r&r.  we got pretty drunk.  you guys sounded like you were partying also.  did you have fun?\u000a
p9403
aV\u000a\u000athat actually works out better for me.  i will meet you at mi luna at 7.  that is the place in the village correct?\u000a
p9404
aV\u000a\u000anext week is good for me.  let 's just go get a drink after work or something.  who is your new roommate going to be? that sucks you have to waste a saturday moving.\u000a
p9405
aV\u000a\u000ai went to denver east.  have you heard of it?  i haven't heard of your friends that work here.  i like working here.  it is pretty exciting on the trading floor.  are you guys going out tomorrow night after the rehersal dinner.\u000a
p9406
aV\u000a\u000ai don't know for sure but that is what one of jen's friends said.  i didn't know if you guys had heard that or not.  don't bring it up if max hasn't mentioned it.  i think miami would be a lot more fun.\u000a
p9407
aV\u000a\u000asorry i didn't call you back last night.  i didn't get home until late.  looks bad over here.  everything was business as usual until yesterday.  i think our books were so cooked that it is beyond repair.  i will call you later.\u000a
p9408
aV\u000a\u000ahey grandma.  how is it going?  i just purchased my ticket for grand forks today.   i get in on saturday the 9th @ 12:20pm.  i am looking foward to seeing everyone.\u000a\u000alove matt\u000a
p9409
aV\u000a\u000aonly one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you wouldn't let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just venting frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober.\u000a
p9410
aV\u000a\u000ai didn't get your email in time.  my number is 713-807-1699h and 713-825-8410c.  we went to sierra and it sucked.  total banana farm.\u000a
p9411
aV\u000a\u000ai just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office.  i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career.  although this year has been up and down, i am enjoying my role on the desk.  i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up.  the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver.  we can talk more about it if you would like on monday.\u000a
p9412
aV\u000a\u000athe only thing at la strada is a bunch of nancy boys.  are your friends trying to meet gay guys or are they gay?\u000a
p9413
aV\u000a\u000awhat did you do this weekend?  i gave you a shout on fri to go out.  you didn't miss much.  we went to the grasshopper and that joint sucks.  it is really cheesy.\u000a
p9414
aV\u000a\u000ai found a bunch of tickets to fargo.  most run through minneapolis.  the cheapest is $432.  the earliest arrives at 12:30 and they have one at 2, 3, 5.  let me know what you guys have and i will coordinate the times accordingly.\u000a
p9415
aV\u000a\u000ai was sober and i remember how it went down.  i said one rude thing in the car and that was it.  you were just going nuts and wouldn't let it die.  you kept flipping out on me.\u000a
p9416
aV\u000a\u000awhat is going on?  so is the wedding in miami now?  do i need to buy some club clothes for south beach?\u000a
p9417
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>-\u000a\u000aI manage a restricted gas product on EOL.  The product is PG&E Topock # 51408.  I need to add Occidental Energy Trading and TXU Energy Marketing to the list of counterparties that have access to this product.

p9419
aV\u000a\u000ai just want to meet some models down there.  i don't hang out at discos thought, but if i was in miami i guess i would.  i think i would need some new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis.\u000a
p9420
aV\u000a\u000ai remember you.  i was pretty drunk though.  hopefully i didn't make too much of an ass out of myself.  we hit it really hard that night for my buddy's birthday.  how was your bachelorette party?  are you back in austin now?\u000a
p9421
aV\u000a\u000astep up and go out like a man.  stop crying like a lil' bitch.   sierra is gonna be packed with girls dressed like lil hookers.  go home, nap and then be ready to go by 8:30-9.\u000a
p9422
aV\u000a\u000ai still need to decide whether or not i am going.  i think this guy is putting an offer on my house and i might need to look for a house.  how was bama?  did you party after we rolled them or was kenny to pissed?\u000a
p9423
aV\u000a\u000aare you going out this weekend?  i think you said you had a wedding to go to or something?     were you hurting on wednes morning?\u000a
p9424
aV\u000a\u000ai haven't watched them at all.  every time i try to watch hockey they are not on.   i am gonna watch their next series.  who are they gonna play?\u000a
p9425
aV\u000a\u000adid you talk to her recently or something?  i have been out of time a lot this month.  i went to vegas this weekend and i feel like shit now.  i had fun with her, but i really didn't hear too much from her so i  just took it as an indication.\u000a
p9426
aV\u000a\u000ano problem.  hull said it wouldn't be a good party anyway.  you know you didn't fall asleep, it is called passing out.\u000a
p9427
aV\u000a\u000ai forgot you had a wedding.  i don't go up to austin all that much.  i usually stay down here and go out.  where do you work up there again?  i am sure you told me, but i forgot.  where are the good places to hang out?  is it 4th st?\u000a
p9428
aV\u000a\u000amy bad man.  i got your message around 930 and i went to bed after that.  let's hook up with them this weekend.  what is up for tonight?  i say we hit club no minor on sat and then uropa.  we need to tear it up some.\u000a
p9429
aV\u000a\u000ai think we should wait in line at the grasshopper next time so we don't waste our night.  we will know for next weekend.\u000a
p9430
aV\u000a\u000ai don't want to be a soilder during the war.  where are you going if you go out?  sierra?  let me knwo if you decide to go out b/c i think it would be a fun night.\u000a
p9431
aV\u000a\u000ayour past few months have been just as bad.  at least i didn't close uropa b/c i was puking in the bathroom.\u000a
p9432
aV\u000a\u000ayeah i had one.   her name was mandy and she was the sweetest dog and my dad has one currently and the dog isnt retarded.  all dogs are dumb.  they are called dumb friends b/c they don't speak.\u000a
p9433
aV\u000a\u000ai will be in town.  i have a dinner to go to at 6:30, but i am going out after that.  you should give me a call.  i think you have my cell phone number right?\u000a
p9434
aV\u000a\u000amy friends are liars.  this past weekend was an anomaly.  it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then.  i will be in austin this saturday night, so maybe we can get together in austin.  we will probably be at it pretty hard again.  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street.\u000a
p9435
aV\u000a\u000ashe called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the beans on the plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we would spend over a grand each.    miami will rock.\u000a
p9436
aV\u000a\u000ai wasn't that drunk on saturday.  i was just joking.  i felt great on saturday.  like a champ.  people get married younger than you?  wow.  what the hell do they do if they get married that early?\u000a
p9437
aV\u000a\u000asorry i didn't call you back last night.  i got home around 9:30.  i will give you a call tonight.  how about the huskers?  that was violent.\u000a
p9438
aV\u000a\u000ai can't come the last week b/c of work.  that is when prices get set for next month gas.  it is a very busy week and there is no way for me to get out of it.  when are grandma and grandpa coming?\u000a
p9439
aV\u000a\u000ameeting up with boone and luis and whoever.  if the broker goes we will just get some free drinks.  date went well.  i had a good time.\u000a
p9440
aV\u000a\u000awho told you if you look good with hair you will look good without it?  that sounds like a george costanza.  hair is important to women under 45.  i wish i could make this ski trip and see you in action again, but south beach calls.\u000a
p9441
aV\u000a\u000ai have to go to butt-fucking mississippi.  i am not looking foward to that but don't tell val.  the following weekend i will be ready to rock.\u000a
p9442
aV\u000a\u000ai am at the venitian.  i am going to stay in the rainman suite.  should be a good time.  i can load up and get some hookers and just have an old fashioned good time.  it is a good stress relief.\u000a
p9443
aV\u000a\u000ajen's dad better buy a bunch of booze.  and the schrutt's better take us somewhere nice for the rehersal dinner.  and jen's friends better put out.\u000a
p9444
aV\u000a\u000ayep.  i was going to try and talk to her but she was reading and listening to a walkman.  i was sweating like a freak when i was running.  probably scared her.  it looked like i was evaporating.\u000a
p9445
aV\u000a\u000adaily dose on enron - \u000a\u000awe are finished.  i need to now get a job at house of pies b/c that is the only way to pay the bills.  the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.  can't go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket.\u000a
p9446
aV\u000a\u000ai am just kidding.  i wouldn't ever pay for it.  anyway i am going with people from work so it woulnd't look to good if i was bringing hookers into my room.\u000a
p9447

aV\u000a\u000ai am sure they are.  houston won't be too affected b/c most of the layoffs affect satelite offices.  economy should be good here.\u000a
p9450
aV\u000a\u000ai went to high school in denver.  i have only lived here for 2 years.  no wonder you hate houston.  there is nothing up in north houston.\u000a
p9451
aV\u000a\u000athey did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset.  the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire.  skilling and fastow bolted.  i have no respect for them.  i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 89, but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 80 and we are taken over at 110.  not 90 down to 10.\u000a
p9452
aV\u000a\u000alet's definately go next thurs.  i didn't hit it either b/c the hockey game was on.  did you get a date for tonight?  i am going out with one of those p.t.s.  let me know and maybe we can meet up.\u000a

p9456
aV\u000a\u000ai live inside the loop here and usually don't leave unless i have to golf.  outside of the loop is pretty ugly.  which part of houston did you grow up in?\u000a
p9457
aV\u000a\u000ait depends what type you get.  if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like that dog.  if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place.  those little furry dogs act like cats.\u000a
p9458
aV\u000a\u000atim should have it.  so are you getting nervous.  vegas rocked.  what time does the wedding start and how long of a drive is it?  i bet you're nervous.  let me know if we need to keep  a car running out front.\u000a

p9463
aV\u000a\u000atimes are getting tight for me.  i really liked that house i saw yesterday.  i figure since you are not spending money on a dog you can spend it on me.\u000a
p9464
aV\u000a\u000acomfort suites is like $800 total for 4 nights.  cheap as it gets down there.  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money.  only condition is that ryan doesn't go on a booze cruise and piss on himself.\u000a
p9465
aV\u000a\u000ai think they are all bark and no bite.  i think they could get their asses kicked by cats.  they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk.  you should get a cockerspaniel.\u000a
p9466

p9469
aV\u000a\u000asusan forgot to reply to all.  i think this was directed at you bass.  \u000a\u000a\u000asusan said:\u000awhy the heck am I getting all the crap on this one....I'm not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself.\u000a
p9470

p9471
aV\u000a\u000ai told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat, and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip?\u000a

p9475
aV\u000a\u000adoes that make a nice scent when baby oil and lotion are mixed?  i am first going to rub fake tan all over and then grease up.  i am just going to wear my new thong and my new gold bracelet.  i am going to look awesome when i am dancing.  i don't know what you should be.  i think you can do better than gi jane though.  you could be an umpalumpa for willy wonka.  everyone loves those little guys.\u000a
