aV\u000a\u000aWe can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red <NAME/> - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTo EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately, SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring all such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror forever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence the following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours after the preceeding sanction):\u000a1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended\u000a2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens\u000a3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations\u000a4.

aV\u000a\u000aOur plans are to continue to use <NAME/> as long as we are authorized to do so.  We recently sent a justification for keeping her indefinitely, but, as yet, have not heard anything back.  I can not give an end date because I have no plans to end the arrangement.  If we are forced to terminate this arrangement with <NAME/>, we would have to add at least 1 full time position and the quality of our service would suffer greatly.  Please advise <NAME/> Kilmer and myself of the steps we need to take to continue to use <NAME/> indefinitely.

I believe I gave <NAME/> a list of the distributors - <NAME/> will not be able to continue and <NAME/> and <NAME/> have indicated they would like some relief also.  On the positive side, <NAME/>(?) in the 300 block of Welch (with the new baby) has said she would like to help.  \u000a\u000aI can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor?  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aA quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.  We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.  PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.  My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.   Then nothing happens.  There are two things we need to do to prevent this.\u000a\u000a	One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.  Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.\u000a\u000a	Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.\u000a\u000aHopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.\u000a\u000aThanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

We should be running wheels N-S and S-N across Path 15, the COI and NOB. We have lost significant revenue by failing to adjust bid our transactions. It is still fire season, and unit outages are resulting in unscheduled flow problems that are forcing congestion at different tie points and in different directions. Please check available ATC's on the CAISO site, and spend the time to manage our congestion risk. If you have questions, please ask. We need everyone up to speed on this quickly.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is from a guy on our floor.  He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story.  Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose.  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher.  Didn't find one, and like <NAME/> (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for <NAME/> employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or "You've Gotta See This" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,"Somebody get me outta here!"...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness <NAME/> from middle marketing doing his best <NAME/> Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, <NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000aEnjoyable or what?\u000aGive me a call and let me know what is up.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a503-274-0502\u000a503-887-3449 cell\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aWe have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below.\u000a\u000aSo, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.\u000a\u000a1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)\u000a\u000a2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.\u000a\u000a3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.\u000a\u000a4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be:\u000aMalin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain <NAME/>, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.\u000a\u000aBad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.\u000a\u000a5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. \u000a\u000a	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners. \u000a\u000a	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.\u000a\u000a6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.\u000a\u000aEpmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, take a quick look at this would you?\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aGoing forward we will be transacting with <NAME/> Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy.  <NAME/> Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the <NAME/> Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide <NAME/> Canada with their estimate or feel of the market.  <NAME/> Canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission.  If this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, WE need to tell them, as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny with zero chance for return.  Further, <NAME/> Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  If we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP, IPC or TransAlta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations.  If we are in contact with <NAME/> Canada before hand (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with the NW counterparty that the energy is non-firm.  Determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow.  We are basically buying a put or a call.  Finally, I would like to see the communication with <NAME/> Canada improve.  Personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both <NAME/> Canada and <NAME/> North America.  This is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with <NAME/> Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with <NAME/> Canada please let me know.\u000a\u000aTo be sent to <NAME/> Zufferli (equivalent of <NAME/> B in Canada)\u000aand Portland Shift\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a**Per <NAME/> at EPE, the following is new for 2002. I will attempt to get more information and pass it on as I receive it.**\u000a\u000aFirst, TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE.  The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP. Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale.  Second, SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load, SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the <NAME/> tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC. Again, this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO.\u000a\u000a**The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo. 25 is firm just like the last two years, 50 is econ. and can be varied by PNM each hour.**\u000a\u000aPlease ask if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.

aV\u000a\u000aCheck this out...you should read Liar's Poker by <NAME/> <NAME/>, and Den of Thieves.\u000aGood stuff.\u000a \u000a \u000aHe notes that <NAME/> management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that <NAME/> alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the <NAME/> book right now.---sch\u000aIs <NAME/> the New Drexel? \u000aBy <NAME/> <NAME/>, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''\u000aBerkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- <NAME/> Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. \u000aThe boss, <NAME/> Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. \u000aUnderstandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. \u000aOther than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, <NAME/> Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. \u000aAlumni <NAME/> Flourish \u000aTrue, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and <NAME/>'s energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. \u000aJust as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former <NAME/> traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and <NAME/> Energy Corp. Well before <NAME/> Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. \u000aBut the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. \u000aThere was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The <NAME/> bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. \u000aDifferent Motivations \u000a<NAME/> created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What <NAME/> hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. \u000a(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as <NAME/> seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought <NAME/> down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did <NAME/>, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) \u000aThe speed with which the markets have punished <NAME/> reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In <NAME/>'s case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. \u000aIn Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In <NAME/>'s, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.\u000a

Next time I am down there (?) you'll have to provide a demonstration.  I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 (this seems to happen about every 6 months), I have only driven it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).  Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).  An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).  Other ideas?\u000a\u000aSo I am in the new place.  It's great!  Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).  Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.

The bankruptcy of <NAME/> has been a bit rough, but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity.

Right now, I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again. Portland has been fun the past couple weeks, there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast. I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping. I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have attached a revised budget forecast for 2002. The 2002 headcount  (column D) is now correct at the top of the budget. I do not have a number from <NAME/> Steiner yet regarding technology costs (row 107) but I am expecting it soon. Everything else is pretty much as you and I discussed earlier today. Please call me with any questions.\u000aThank you for the help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p105
aV\u000a\u000aGentlemen,\u000a\u000aAfter discussion with <NAME/>, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. \u000aI apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aWe are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.\u000a\u000aFor Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone. \u000a\u000aDo call with questions.\u000aCell: 503-887-3449\u000aHome: 503-274-0502\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aJust a quick reminder.\u000aWhen we are notified by the CAISO Generation desk regarding a "waiver" for an <NAME/> managed unit in California, we should notify the services desk if it is during the day, and should email the services desk (and me) if it is after normal work hours. If you have questions please just let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p110
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th, but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities. I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort. A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread. \u000a\u000aIf you have any questions, just let me know. Otherwise keep up the good work!\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI have some information regarding our payment to MPC that you and I discussed yesterday. Apparently we cut them a check for $19,937.35 (or thereabouts). The check no. is 9600043219. The check was cut on 01/15/02. MPC does not know why they received this payment. <NAME/> Bruegger is my contact at MPC.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aJust a quick heads up for the flash.\u000aPath 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. \u000aIf you have any questions, please let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p114
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aThere is a new schedule out for October. Please take a look at it. If you need to switch days, feel free.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aHello. How are you? What are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. It has been a while to say the least, but the other day <NAME/> and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough). I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.  <NAME/> said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.  I hope you don't mind.  \u000a\u000aAnyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.  I began trading power about a year and a half ago for <NAME/>.  I now manage the  west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San <NAME/>, right?)...  \u000a\u000aMy job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland <NAME/> Museum.  The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.  It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.  It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.  The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.  The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.\u000a\u000aSo, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.\u000a\u000aTake care.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aST-WBOM is importing 20 mws for HE 2 and 3, and 10 mws for HE 4 and 5 at MEAD 230. I have made the Enpower deals (868223, 868224, 868234) to buy from PinWest and sell to the imbalance in SP-15. I have entered the schedule in CAPS and it should be good to go.\u000a\u000aST-WBOM also purchased 10 mws from Redding in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. <NAME/> <NAME/> brokered this deal.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aCan we contact this <NAME/> Johnson guy and tell him he is a pawn for the state of California... Funny...I don't remember a "near-meltdown", just inept purchasing and load balancing by CERS at the start of August. CERS is consistently completely out of the market. EVERY DAY!

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aCuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below. \u000a\u000aWe will be handling cuts in the following manner:\u000a\u000a1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.\u000a\u000a2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.\u000a\u000a3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).\u000a\u000a4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position.\u000a\u000a5. Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on <NAME/> Symes' Desk.\u000a\u000aI appreciate your help and diligence.\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aKeoni,\u000a\u000aHere are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.\u000a \u000aI spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.\u000a\u000aI then called <NAME/> at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold <NAME/> 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.\u000a\u000aI called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.\u000a\u000aI began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.\u000a\u000aI told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.\u000a\u000aI acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.\u000a\u000aI then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.\u000a\u000aI called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.\u000aBhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.\u000a\u000aAt 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.\u000aI called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.\u000a\u000aWhile transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with <NAME/> at SRP marketing and <NAME/> told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.\u000a\u000aI believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. \u000a\u000a\u000aI think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.\u000a\u000aThank you for your help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aKeoni,\u000aI thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up "corrected" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. <NAME/> the change in running the "solutions" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. \u000a\u000aI will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup-\u000aBrace yourselves...\u000aOnce more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the grid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be using congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling.\u000a\u000aAny questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aJust a quick note regarding scheduling on Saturday.  There should be a 25 mw n-firm export for HE 7-10 and HE 13-22.  The schedule ID for HE 7-10 was CISO_EPMI_BUNNY.  The schedule ID for HE13-22 was EPMI_CISO_BUNNY.  For HE 11 and HE12, <NAME/> at the CISO misentered our schedule.  CAPS shows a final of 25 mws as a firm import.  This should be a n-firm export.  We recieved the energy as a firm export from the CISO.  All schedules should be under ECTSTSW not ECTRT.  If you have questions please let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI think you have identified the most pressing issues. Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to "strive for simplicity and transparency." Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be?  In the CISO's proposal the first two "goals" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other. Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points. I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks for the update.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West. I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex. I am considering participating with Dow Jones. I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time. It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks. I am working with <NAME/> and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index. I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to <NAME/> Hall when they arrive.

We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).

I am also meeting with <NAME/> Thompsen who was my analyst pool representative last review period for lunch on Thursday.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Platter\u000a<NAME/> Richter\u000a<NAME/> Stokely\u000a<NAME/> Dunton\u000a<NAME/> Rawson\u000a<NAME/> Fischer\u000a<NAME/> Salisbury\u000a<NAME/> Crandall\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a<NAME/> Rosman\u000a\u000aI assume you will be reviewing me as well.\u000aIf you have any questions, please let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p213
aV\u000a\u000aThese look good from my end.  Thank you for the update.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p214
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aPer our discussion, please allocate all Hour-Ahead Congestion charges or revenues to the ECTRT group. Hopefully this will simplify the management of our books. My understanding is that <NAME/> will tell RT if there are cuts or some other need to put in Hour Ahead (24) schedules for the Cali desk and will allow us to allocate approriate charges or revenue to him if necessary. All Congestion charges/revenue at tie points should still be allocated to the desk entered in CAPS. If you have any questions please see me. RealTime will still try to notify you of Congestion revenue or charges.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p215
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aWe have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report. Please give me a call if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p216
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aI can now be reached with email outside of work at wwilliamsiii@palm.net\u000aThis should work even if my cell does not.\u000a
p217
aV\u000a\u000aGuys,\u000aYou can find out the information you need on the website.\u000aThe website is www.wscc.com, click on certification and training, scroll down to the Schedulers Course manual.  Print off the schedulers course manual and study it.  You will be tested on the material, a pre-test and a post-test. (note:you will need to access the site in Explorer to get the manuals).  You can call telephone# 801-582-0353 to get information on the scheduler's course (this is the main-line to WSCC so you will have to ask around a bit).\u000a\u000aPlease arrange for those on night shift to get in about 15-25 minutes early so you can leave at 5:10 on the 13th.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p218
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aWe recieved congestion relief revenue from the CAISO for Sunday and Monday, August 12th and 13th.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p219
aV\u000a\u000aB-\u000aI will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you. Maybe an early afternoon brew...\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat tire.\u000a
p220
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aWe are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months.\u000a\u000aFirst:\u000aWith EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible.\u000a\u000aSecond:\u000aThe morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and heaters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20. <NAME/> Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC.\u000a\u000aFinally:\u000aWe will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and the final two months of the year.\u000a\u000aPlease see me with any questions regarding the system.\u000a\u000aThank you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p221
aV\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000aAnd sorry again about the stairwell--did you actually get stuck in there?\u000a
p222
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aJust a quick heads up.\u000aSMUD used enron online today and sold ust a total of 125 mws.\u000aThanks for the good work! \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p223
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI just wanted to bring to your attention the volume of congestion that we relieved last night.\u000aIt looks like 28 mws at $198 and 75 mws at $223.00.\u000aThis should be at total revenue of $22,269.00.\u000a\u000aPlease see me with any questions.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p224
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAll deals were originally sourced under ST-NW. Revenue was moved from ST-NW to ST-Whourly for 70/30 split between LP and ST-Whourly.\u000a\u000aAnnuity to ST-Whourly from ST-NW #531524--$23468.76\u000a\u000aAnnuity from ST-Whourly to LP #531549--$12597.73\u000a\u000aAnnuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW #531546--$5472--this compensated for original deal sold to LP (take or pay).\u000a\u000aST-Whourly kept the difference between #531524 and #'s 531549, 531546.\u000a\u000aAll deals were originally sourced under ST-NW.\u000a\u000aIf you have questions, just let me know.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p225
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aWe are short 25 mws in SP15 at $43 for Tuesday.  I am unsure if ST-CALI is doing anything.\u000aWe are short 25 mws at PV at @$50 with ST-SW on EPE lending for Tuesday.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you have questions, and you may want to check prices with these desks.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p226
aV\u000a\u000aI would be TOTALLY thrilled if you could let the group know...now about those MPC numbers...we need to go through the inc sheets and service sheets from last year...and we have half an hour.\u000aB\u000a
p227
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aA quick reminder. The cell phones are for group member to group member usage.  As such, calling between group members, and our 1-800-684-1336 number is free.  We have 200 minutes each for use in calling other members of the West Desk on work related matters.  Over the past two months we have greatly exceeded our allowable minutes per month.  Some members of the group have exceeded their allotment by over 200 minutes per month!    Group member to group member usage is approximately 45-90 minutes per month-and this is not calculated in the minutes used.  If you want to use this phone as your only phone, let me know, and we will work out a calling and billing plan for you. \u000a\u000aThank you,\u000aB\u000a
p228
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI have made some revisions to the budget after spending some time with <NAME/> Fitzpatrick in our HR department. Obviously this is a loose plan (the headcount for the RT group changes frequently)...but it should prove a bit more accurate than nothing. If you have any questions please just let me know. You can call me here at work at 503-464-3730 or on my cell phone at 503-887-3449.\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p229
aV\u000a\u000aGood afternoon.\u000aWe have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13. Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning. The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p230
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aAnother update on the situation with California.\u000aCheck out the letter.\u000aGood questions...\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI have also not been able to approve these. I do need those folks to have access...\u000a
p232
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aSeattle was sweet this weekend. I went and saw <NAME/> at the Breakroom...what did you think of Husky Stadium? Woohoo!\u000aMan, Thursday...whoa...and think, I went out after that...whoa...but it was my birthday...sorry for calling late.\u000aAre you doing anything cool this weekend?  Motorcycle dirt track races are on Saturday night at Portland Speedway...\u000aI am stoked. Plus the first Husky football game is this weekend in Seattle against Michigan!\u000a \u000aHow are other things going? Hopefully well.\u000a \u000aLater,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p233
aV\u000a\u000aYo!\u000aYeah, I am taking a look at it.  How are the interviews coming?  If you want to meet me for lunch, we can grab some pens and go over the thing. I am going to need information from you, and find out what you want to show.  Anything good going on this week?\u000aB\u000a
p234
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aWe will be performing a new service for EES. On Monday, August 6th the ST-CALI desk will have submitted ancillary service bids to the CAISO for EES load.  LADWP will be providing the capacity (SPIN), we will be dispatched over the ADS system, and then need to call the amount into LADWP.  We need to keep track of the amount exercised.  We should do this in the Service Sheet and then record the amount dispatched on the sheet to EES on Tuesday morning as well.  The tags are in the front of the services book for Monday.

p235
aV\u000a\u000aSunil,\u000aPer our conversation on the phone. We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to "personalize" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products. We are currently trading physical firm power at NP-15, SP-15, PV, and Mid-C for hours ending 12-20. A same day filter or hourly product filter would work nicely.\u000aPlease let me know what you might need from me to get this accomplished as quickly as possible.\u000aThanks,\u000a
p236
aV\u000a\u000aKal,\u000aThe delivery points are as follows:\u000a\u000aMid-C, NP-15, SP-15, and PV\u000a\u000aAnd, \u000a\u000aProducts will currently be available for HE 12 through HE 20 Pacific Prevailing Time (PPT), for Monday through Friday.\u000a\u000aI appreciate the hard work.\u000aThanks,\u000a
p237
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSorry for the delay in getting you my accomplishments.  I filled out the self-evaluation portion of the PRC back in May.  I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form.\u000aMy accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment, by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise.\u000a\u000a1. Continue to maximize the abilities of the group, and try to leave nothing on the table.\u000a2. Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes, or other avoidable actions.\u000a3. Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in <NAME/>.\u000a4. Stay ahead of California with regards to political, legal and credit risk.\u000a5. Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities.\u000a6. Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals.\u000a\u000aI greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months.\u000a\u000aIf you have any questions just let me know.\u000aThanks, \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p238
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI will not have time today.  Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p239
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aGood morning, hope you had a good weekend.\u000aI have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.  The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS. Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.  You may want to walk over and "remind" them of this.\u000a\u000aI am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.  Hopefully everything will work.  If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell.\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> will be in at 8.  Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p240
aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000aPlease remember to put the Tag # in the inc sheet. Every schedule should now be tagged if it is outside of the CAISO. Please get the tag # from our counterparties to put in the inc sheet. This should greatly improve our settlements process and minimize disputes. Include a comment in the Tag # section if there is no tag.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p241
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aThanks for the schedule.  Unfortunately I won't be at tonights game or the outdoor game tomorrow.  I should be at the games next week though.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p242
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI need your help with some Enpower applications. Please give me a call as soon as you have an opportunity.\u000aBy the way...I sure hope your Longhorns do NOT end up matched against my Huskies...ouch!\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a1-800-684-1336\u000a
p243
aV\u000a\u000aSweet.  Just grab me after lunch sometime I spose...if that works for you.\u000a
p244
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach (watch out for him!), he moved down there about 3 months ago.  I have been planning on visiting him for a while.  I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down.  Last time I was in LA, I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home.  Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--<NAME/> Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end (the guy was NOT good)--which was nice.  Also, one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show (I think).  So, I definitely need to go down there for a visit.  I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July (16th thru 18th) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off.  So whatever, if I make it down there it should be a decent time.\u000a\u000aSorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland, hope you can make it (though the deck seems stacked against you this time around).  I will plan for you to be here (so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel), but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd.  Plenty of time for that, as the sun should be out for a while (til October anyway). \u000a\u000aI was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday (get a few runs in before 10), but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt. St. Helens on my bike instead.  It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up.  St. Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains.  We'll see though, either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains.\u000a\u000aSo work was solid today, got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to.  No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do?  \u000a\u000aAnyway, hope the funeral goes well (you know...as it can), and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland.  Oh.  And as for a picture, I'll see what I can do.  <NAME/>'s got a couple, but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you.  I admit, I have been called an Ogre before (I am a bit of a taller, bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it), but...well...<NAME/> should be able to fill you in.  Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture.\u000aEnjoy your time in LA,\u000aAnd take care.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p245
aV\u000a\u000aD'<NAME/>,\u000aThis needs to go to <NAME/> <NAME/>, not <NAME/> <NAME/> III.  The difference is subtle but is rather important if you want the correct person to receive your message.\u000aPlease make the appropriate change in your contact lists and address book.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a
p246
aV\u000a\u000aJust need to know why there will be a BOM charge of $5331.90? My impression is that this was totally trued up...\u000aIs this some weird tranny charge?\u000aIdeas...\u000aAs always, if you could go through these charges that would be great, and I like the idea of showing the $96,065.15 this month.\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p247
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August.  I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August.  NP and SP are currently trading near flat.  I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have discussed a month long short at PV with <NAME/> <NAME/>. While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels.  This also represents a relatively low risk trade (under $10 downside).  I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.  If you have concerns or questions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p248
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aCould you meet with me regarding congestion revenue for 10/05?\u000aWe had two wheels that were not in the inc sheet but were awarded by the CAISO and are in finals in CAPS. The wheels were EPMI_CISO_GREEN for HE 17 and HE 18. We were awarded 38.96 mws for HE 17 and 31.92 mws for HE 18. Both wheels were awarded at $54.90.\u000aWe should receive revenue of $3891.31 from these wheels.\u000aPlease give me a shout with questions.\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p249
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust to follow-up from yesterday. Two key real-time customers would be MPC (load balancing agreement) and EPE (power "consulting" agreement). Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important, but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two. As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company (and likely before), I think we need to visit these customers and get them back.\u000a\u000aIdeas?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p250
aV\u000a\u000aJust talked with Kochel. He was expecting a bounce in our stock on funds covering their shorts. I don't know if I agree after this.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p251
aV\u000a\u000aThere will be a 100 mw schedule delivered at COB to NCPA going on NCPA rights into NP-15. <NAME/> Platter will be scheduling the purchase from NCPA in CAPS and submitting an HA 24 schedule. BE sure to watch what is in your templates in the morning.\u000a\u000aThe ST-NW desk will also be short day-ahead to PGE for Friday and Saturday. <NAME/> will be sending an email.\u000a\u000aPlease call me with questions.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p252

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aThe baseball game will be on Thursday July 26th, NOT Monday July 16th.  Gates open at 6:30.  Refreshments and pizza will be provided. \u000aEveryone should plan to attend.  Please let me know if you cannot.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p254
aV\u000a\u000aYou have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing. Things are interesting. <NAME/> is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then). Not too much else is new. My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle. A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it. As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down. Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon). <NAME/> youre doing well.\u000a\u000aWord.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGuys,\u000a\u000aWe are missing the congestion revenue from HE 7 on Saturday morning (10 mws at $99.00) in the flash we received yesterday.

aV\u000a\u000aYou are correct, \u000aThe EOL trades were not properly acccounted for. \u000aWe need FSP 2000, not FSP 2002...\u000aI think we have it sorted out now though.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, too much stress is never healthy...I don't know exactly what the deal is.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aI have discussed our lack of handsets with <NAME/> Steiner.  <NAME/> perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.  These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.  If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know. <NAME/> Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.  <NAME/> suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out). I feel this goes without saying but maybe...\u000a\u000aThanks for your help with this.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aWhen buying from any desk on the floor, you should have a sale from that desk (say ST-CALI) to either WHourly or WBOM, then do enpower as normal. The interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in Enpower to the physical buy by the other desk (another words...ST-CALI buys from imbalance, sells to WHourly/WBOM, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPMICALPOOL, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPE.\u000aPlease let me know if you have questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAccording to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGroup,\u000a\u000aRecently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of our group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearence of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on our floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to <NAME/> Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.\u000a\u000aThe kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.\u000a\u000aWe continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.\u000a\u000a\u000aIn summary, <NAME/>'s performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI didn't know you were living in an apartment.  When did this happen.  What do you mean repair or rebuild?  I hate to hear about you and <NAME/>.  That is too bad.  Didn't she know you were a piece of shit when she married you!  I hate that these women forget that we have always been shitty.  \u000a \u000aThe kids are great!  <NAME/> is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and <NAME/> get along really well.\u000a \u000aToo hard to tell what will happen with Dynegy.  Not sure I want to work for this new regime.  I guess it all comes down to money.  As always I'm still a whore.\u000a
p335
aV\u000a\u000aAre they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is <NAME/> going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?\u000a
p336
aV\u000a\u000aI am so sorry about <NAME/>.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  <NAME/> was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me <NAME/> was everything a man was supposed to be.  \u000a\u000aIt always made me proud to talk to <NAME/> about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that <NAME/> had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little <NAME/> was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. \u000a\u000aThe thing I always will remember about <NAME/> was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.\u000a\u000aI know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Whitt\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAll of our producers have cut us off, and I hate to try and get them in a deal with us because I don't know if they will get paid.  I would talk to Lee at BR, I know he is under water with the Canadian <NAME/> acquisition.  You would be a major star at Hanover, any interest?  I think I would talk to Kinder Morgan.  They have a lot of projects on the books, as well as Calpine.  They really need gas help.\u000a\u000aGood Luck and stay in touch.\u000a

p373
aV\u000a\u000aI had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that <NAME/>'s books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and <NAME/> are running numbers to determine <NAME/>'s "extrinsic value".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets .\u000a
p374
aV\u000a\u000aENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder <NAME/> basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder <NAME/> Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  \u000a\u000aAs you may or may not know, <NAME/> has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.\u000a\u000aThere are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.\u000a\u000aThese developers recognize that they need <NAME/>'s assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:\u000a\u000a1.  Power Marketing and Project development\u000a2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access\u000a3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise\u000a\u000aGiven the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.\u000a\u000aTherefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (<NAME/> <NAME/> would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in <NAME/> with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.\u000a\u000aPlease give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!\u000a\u000aThanks a lot.\u000a\u000a303-575-6473\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aYou know that ENA sold our pipeline assets to Northern Border Partners in Q3 of 2001.  That is what became Crestone.  The list I gave you is of who we do business with now.\u000a
p376
aV\u000a\u000aI am never big on utility guys.  This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas compared to U.S. supplies.  I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.\u000a\u000aEnvironmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aAs discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.\u000a\u000aI am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from <NAME/> for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     \u000a\u000aThe benefit in this swap would be:\u000ahedge against floating price\u000alock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues\u000aavoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPlease let me know what you think.      <NAME/> will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   \u000aI  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.\u000a\u000aAdditionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.\u000a\u000a\u000aLet me know what you think,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a713-853-7160\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest.\u000aThey both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.\u000a\u000aThe jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.\u000aHe tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.\u000a\u000aAnyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the <NAME/> county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.     \u000aShe got the kids and he pays $2500/month.\u000a\u000aLife is less fair to dumbasses\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

That's why she turned toward us.\u000aShe is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or <NAME/> wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.\u000a\u000aIm not coming until February at the earliest.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes,  but was unsuccessful.    I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.     Enpower is out of balance  and the books are as well.  \u000aRisk management/Settlements wants this balanced,  as we cannot tie out with our customers.\u000a\u000aWe will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status,  then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.\u000a\u000aYou mention inadvertancy in your Notes,  but I dont know the particulars of this problem.    I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.     If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift,   then you should be in balance when you leave.\u000aThe Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.\u000a\u000aGive me a call to straighten this out.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe have created a quick quide to do QSE trades through the Ercot Portal.    This initial guide should get you started, however,  this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation.     I am asking you to read the rules and implement a trade using the Portal.    As you have noticed,   our counterparties have already started trading two hours out.       We will be trading paralell until the ISO rolls out for Friday.   This means that you will have to submit the "traditional" Ercot Oasis and also submit the QSE trade.    We must monitor to make sure that our counterparties have submitted their matching QSE trades, as well.   Otherwise we will be out of balance with Ercot.\u000a\u000a\u000aA copy of our QSE quide will be in your inbox.

aV\u000a\u000aJerrry,\u000a\u000aSee the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.    We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the	OOM  (Out of Merit)  decrease for today.   It is our understanding,  per the protocols,  that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35  scheduled sale  whole.    We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of:  the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.    If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive:\u000a$35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.   \u000a\u000aFor the capacity tomorrow,\u000aWe will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.    The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.    The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed.  \u000a  At the time of deployment,  we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised.\u000aWe bid in a  Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 ".   They can take partial hours, at their option.\u000a\u000aI hope this helps.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000aDirector, EPMI\u000a

This is great!!\u000aEach day I review balancing energy prices vs.  daily prices and the choice is extremely simple:    We allow the pool to fill this load.\u000a\u000aI would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.     There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.\u000a\u000aDo we need to discuss this further?   I just want to be on the same page.\u000aLet me know what you think.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGreetings - I have attached the most basic expectations for our group.   We have been spending a lot of time balancing the books lately, and the attached will relieve some of this, so we can focus on trading.   I will make sure that we receive balanced books from Day ahead trading/scheduling.\u000aAlso,  make an effort to know why we run reports, etc.  so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation. \u000a\u000aI will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in Enpower and Lotus Notes.      \u000a\u000aWe have a good group and we will do well in the new market.    However,  this will take an extra effort from each of us.\u000aIf you have questions about any of the expectations,   ask.    That is why we make the list.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour.\u000aThe same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.\u000a\u000aIs Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?\u000a\u000aI will be out of the office next week,   so can you reply to <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith?

This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being "balanced down."\u000a\u000aWe should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.     If this situation happens,  we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO.\u000aThis is an important part of the Services side of our business,  and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.\u000a\u000a\u000aIf anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Maybe also an oil leak fixed.     Also,   I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing.\u000aThe Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars,  the clutch being a common and costly repair. \u000a\u000aThe exterior of the car is in fair condition.

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.\u000a\u000aI have notified Presto that I would be joining <NAME/> in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in <NAME/>,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in <NAME/> may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.\u000a\u000aI am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.       \u000a\u000aThanks for your time,\u000a\u000aJ Forney\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMr. Hinson,\u000aSorry I missed your call.      The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.      Three units in total,  however,   the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.    I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.\u000a\u000aThere is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.       These units are behind a common point,  so the rules as they were written dont consider us.     \u000a\u000aI know that this is more than you asked for,  but for whatever it's worth........\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks and give me a call if you need more info,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/> Ercot Region\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Patterson, our Rep,  called today to ask me if everything was resolved to my satisfaction.    I relayed that I did talk to <NAME/> Adams last night and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    This is great,  however,   <NAME/> warned me that we were outside of the tariff because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.\u000aHe relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.     <NAME/> Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of potential QSE liability.\u000a\u000aIn my opinion we need to:\u000aCall <NAME/> Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwise we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest this ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability."\u000aOfficially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is a start.   I am having our Regulatory guy review our OOMC/OOME situation.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p502
aV\u000a\u000aA lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.\u000aNo problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.\u000aYou need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed.\u000aThanks,\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSo,  it would appear that we have a good case for recovering some money for OOME?   I am of the opinion that for every time I was ordered to run under the OOMC,  I should be paid the OOME calc.\u000aIs this flawed logic?  What do you think.\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p506
aV\u000a\u000aWe are short 50 mw's for offpeak tomorrow @ $13.    I would not expect to have to fill this,  but if you do,  buy in the South and schedule under Ercot Asset.\u000aWe originally purchased this power from El Paso.\u000a\u000aCall me with questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

So,  we are selling you next day for $22.25.\u000aAlso,  to fill Mirant's call for 12-22 we purchased $23 power from Aquila.    This should get you flat for the day.\u000a\u000aWe will not run tomorrow,  as of now.    We will reflect this in the Resource Plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline.\u000a
p511
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aThe Frontera file has, in the first tab,   their calculation for their daily costing.\u000a<NAME/> gave me this and asked me what I think.

p513
aV\u000a\u000aWe must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.  \u000a For example,   when we have availability,    or even "must sell"  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem. \u000a\u000aThey have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.    \u000a\u000a\u000aFor now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door.\u000aIn Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000aJMForney\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aFrom time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions.\u000aIf you recognize someone from another firm,  or know who they are,  do not discuss their interest in <NAME/> with anyone else.\u000a\u000aRecently,  we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with <NAME/>.  Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.    Totally unacceptable.     I have to ensure that this information is not coming from  my group, hence this note.\u000a\u000aCommon sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.   If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.   \u000a\u000aThanks for your attention to this very important issue.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> - \u000aHow is business?   Things not as fun here as PDX.\u000aI am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate:    1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.    It has 64k and the interior is flawless.\u000aThe exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips,  etc in the front.    The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well.\u000aThe guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.     It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.\u000a\u000aHeres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.\u000a\u000aDo you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k.\u000aWhat am I missing here?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p523
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>,\u000aI have a question:  on the Ercot transmission outage  page,   the TU  Bellmead station is listed as having trouble - the buss is damaged due to storm.    Is this the reason that there are TU CSC's, as mentioned on the Ercot conference call?  The station is to be out until August 10th.  We have had a significant price split and I think that this might be the specific reason.\u000aI have tried powerworld,  but I couldnt turn off this station.\u000a\u000aWhat do you think?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aErcot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain:   \u000aSometimes when we are  submitting an hourly schedule, through the Ercot Portal,  the Day-ahead schedules are affected.\u000aMismatches for every counterparty occur.     We are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly, even for one hour.\u000a    <NAME/> Saibi spoke with the Ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side.\u000a\u000aI called Ercot  and after some time,  they relayed that they were experiencing server problems.\u000a\u000aAttached below is the ticket number related to this problem.   If this occurs again,   make sure that you reference this number.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAJ,\u000aThanks for checking in with me.   I had a couple of questions:\u000aDoes Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?      I currently do several things:\u000aI am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.    I also manage the Ercot Asset book.   I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas.\u000aI am required to trade gas along with  the power in order to properly hedge the plant.\u000aI would be interested in continuing in this area. \u000a\u000aThanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.   I could send my resume,  but if we dont have paralell needs,  then I wont bother.\u000aI have some other things that I am working on.\u000a\u000aThanks again for asking.  This company will be fine,  but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.   When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.   However,   although I am sure that <NAME/> will bounce back,  I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.    \u000a\u000aI have been consistenly profitable in my time here.   I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company,  so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.\u000a\u000aAnyway,  thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aYesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was "unavailable and offline".  \u000a   The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.\u000a\u000aErcot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.\u000aI called <NAME/> Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.\u000a\u000aHis reply is as follows:\u000a\u000aSince we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available.\u000aSince we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.\u000aWe would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday.\u000aIf we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.   \u000aThe Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan "on the fly"  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.\u000a\u000a\u000aUntil further notice, the following policy should be implemented:\u000a\u000aIf Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.\u000a\u000aIf Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:\u000a\u000a$50 premium for OOM up.\u000a$10 premium for OOM down.\u000a\u000aThese premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.\u000aIf we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.\u000a\u000aIf we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.\u000a\u000aPlease call me if you have questions,\u000a\u000aJ.

aV\u000a\u000aWe are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.    OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt.\u000aErcot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.   I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.\u000a\u000aAlso at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.    Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.   So,  for the times that we were asked to run,  Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.\u000a\u000aHow far can we go back in a dispute?  I thought we were somewhat limited.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p537
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI have elected to stay in <NAME/> until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have "lost" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).\u000aThere is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   <NAME/> <NAME/> has offered me an opportunity to trade around <NAME/>'s assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith.\u000aBoth <NAME/> and <NAME/> know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.\u000a\u000aThese opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.\u000a\u000aThis compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what <NAME/> has created concerning job responsibilities.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.\u000aThis explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the "back corner."\u000aThe senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.\u000a\u000aA particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.\u000a\u000aI am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.\u000a\u000aThere are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.\u000a\u000aWell,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister <NAME/>.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.\u000aHopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.   \u000a\u000aLater,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question.\u000aCould you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail?\u000aIf I cannot answer the question,  then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep.\u000a\u000aThe Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed.\u000aThis is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.\u000a\u000aLet me know what you have.\u000a
p545
aV\u000a\u000aPlease make the following arrangements for me in order to join <NAME/> and <NAME/> in Tampa for the Teco meeting:\u000a\u000a7/16 - Depart Hobby to Tampa at 7:50pm flight.\u000aStay at Hyatt - <NAME/> Miller has made the arrangements already.\u000a\u000a7/17 - Depart Tampa 4:30, arrive <NAME/> 6:35pm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI will  be calling on Friday to check on this.   Remember,  I will be on vacation Friday and Monday.   I was scheduled to take Tuesday off, but I will have to attend this meeting.\u000aPlease do not schedule a vacation day for me on Tuesday.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p546
aV\u000a\u000aCorry,\u000aCan you add me as a trader in Enpower under Ercot Asset?    Also,  please add Alex McElreath as a trader under Teco Services.\u000aAdditionally,   Alex is not able to get into Lotus Notes and, ultimately,   East Power Scheduling Discussion.  \u000a<NAME/> Miller needs access to East Power discussion - he has Lotus Notes.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe are doing a good job in deal entry accuracy.    I have had few instances where I am asked by Risk Mgmt to troubleshoot problems,  as had been the case the previous months.\u000aGOOD JOB !\u000a\u000aPlease stay focused on this \u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p548
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI spoke with <NAME/> directly about <NAME/>'s e-mail and concerns.    <NAME/> said that <NAME/> of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     <NAME/> did mention to <NAME/> that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    <NAME/>,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   <NAME/> and <NAME/> sent their resumes.\u000a\u000aI have spoken directly with <NAME/> about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and <NAME/> has apologized.\u000a\u000aHow do you feel about this:   \u000aif we hire <NAME/>,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and <NAME/> could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that <NAME/> may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.\u000a\u000aLet me know - sorry for the very awkward  situation.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p549
aV\u000a\u000aFYI,\u000aThis morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.\u000a\u000aThe point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.\u000a\u000a\u000aPlease see the e-mail below from <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am scheduled to be out of the office for a few days in late August.    The dates are specifically 8/22, 23 and 24th.   \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p551
aV\u000a\u000aFrontera was asked to generate 135 mw's for this day.    They were generating but our meter read was showing zero.    Ercot was also showing zero.\u000a<NAME/> Olinde called and Frontera assured us that they were running.     \u000aWe will need to file a dispute for approx hours ending 1 - 7?\u000aI am not sure when the meter came back,  but it was ok when I came in this morning.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe Oklaunion plant is offline until midnight Friday.    I have replaced the power for this deal in the cash market.   \u000aNo replacement is needed.\u000aAlso;\u000aYou will notice that from peak on through 24, the pool has been strong.     Generators are taking their units offline for offpeak and are running short until peak the next day.\u000aYou can recognize this in the ACE display on the monitor.   Notice hour ending 3,4,5.   Theyre draggin.\u000aPrices still havent done much in the offpeak,even with this going on.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks for checking -  very unhappy with the situation here.    Very unprofessional and juvenile atmosphere.     Looking to leave the company if something doesnt open up internally.     \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p555
aV\u000a\u000aOkay,  so we now have a procedure.   I will broadcast to the group and see that it is implemented.   I still havent completed all of their discrepancy checkout.\u000aI have been working nights through the weekend and tonite.    I will address these on Tuesday.\u000a<NAME/> will be helping me to resolve these and future issues.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSave the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.\u000a\u000aYou can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following:\u000a10/25/01\u000a10/26/01\u000a\u000aTo view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.\u000aI used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.\u000a\u000aThis should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.\u000a\u000aLet me know your feedback.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p557
aV\u000a\u000aJuanster,\u000aCan I get a copy of your group's expectations?    I need to also discuss with you the duties of all the night guys.    As I understand it,     they  all pitch in to do confirms and they unofficially cross-train in other regions.     What about reconciliation reports - what is required?   What other reports need to be tied out -  the Sched Activity report vs. the P&L sheet?\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMy desk is available for training purposes at night or weekends.    However,     I am missing my notebook and my tradelog.   \u000aFrequently things are moved and I have a hard time finding such items as listed above.\u000a\u000aIf you use my desk and you need to move my notebook, etc.   then place them in my desk drawer or somewhere else that makes sense.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aThanks for spending time with me yesterday.   I have spoken with <NAME/> May concerning what my status was.   I mentioned that my preference would be to return to Portland,  however,  I would be considering other options within the company for one week.\u000aMy thought was that I need to relay this same message to Presto,  <NAME/> and <NAME/>.     I will communicate this today,  unless you have other ideas.\u000a\u000aAs discussed,  I have attached a copy of my resume.   It is getting kind of long,  but I havent really gotten a chance to "abbreviate."\u000a\u000aThanks again for helping,  \u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a<NAME/> all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO.\u000aHe reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.\u000a\u000aWe were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.\u000a\u000aHowever,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market.\u000aThe replacement reserve prices have been zero.\u000a\u000aCould you provide some help on this?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000aJ Forney\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe opportunity here has been enhanced;   in addition to Managing RT,   I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.   This includes trading around a 500 mw plant,   serving EES and New Power Company loads,  and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal. \u000aOf course,  I would have to have all of this in writing.      I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.\u000aThis makes the offer more attractive,  but still I would be in <NAME/>.      I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.\u000aWhat do you think?\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p571
aV\u000a\u000aPlease note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas,  the listed static scheduling fee applies.   \u000a\u000aReliant/HLP  - $49\u000aTNMP  - $55\u000aCOA   -  $40\u000aBEC  - $25\u000a\u000a\u000aFor example,  if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA,   the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat  $65.      Also applicable would be the per mw  line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22  .    \u000aPlease account for all such charges in the P&L report.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe are short on the offpeak for the three days including saturday,  sunday,  and monday.

We are currently,  as of Friday,  experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.  These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred.\u000aWe have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.   We have done so.  When the other units become available,   please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.    We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.\u000a\u000aIf you have questions,   give me a call.    \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000awe checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed.     That's not suprising,  however.\u000aDoes Reliant bill this directly or does the Ercot ISO bill this to us?     What is the reason for this fee?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aJust a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm <NAME/>.\u000aOur phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.\u000a\u000aOne of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.\u000aHe sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.\u000aHe maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    \u000aMost importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.\u000a\u000aAgain,  thanks for the help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p577
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aGood questions:\u000a1. You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.    Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.       If we wish to schedule mw's across a path,  ie South to North,  we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.     We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission,  rather,  this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.\u000aRisk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.  I will let you know what it is called.\u000a\u000a2.  The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.\u000aMy fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.    We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet,  as Real Time has done for MDEA.     \u000aThe location for this spreadsheet is:\u000a\u000aM:Eservices/applications/services\u000a\u000aWe will request access to this tool for everyone.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p578
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aque paso,   juaro?    \u000a<NAME/> passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   "Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,"....  Go beetles!\u000aI think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths.\u000aWell,  enough about you,  let's talk about me..............\u000athe Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........\u000a\u000a(Please keep this confidential)\u000aPresto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations.  (thanks for your understanding, bunghole).\u000aI had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision.\u000aI think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However,   thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect other changes would ensue,  once I established this region.\u000a\u000aSo.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which is a huge thing).\u000aI may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     \u000aAnyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.   \u000aI am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart.\u000a\u000aWell,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again,   I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet.\u000aI heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome.    Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding).\u000aI am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.   How is your housing in Taylor?\u000aI miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking hot here in Texas!\u000a\u000aAnyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!   \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a<NAME/> everything is going well with you.   I dont know if <NAME/> has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland.  \u000aI am talking with Wolfe and <NAME/>,  but I would like to keep things low key.    I know this all seems pretty weird,   but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major,  immediate decisions to make.    Basically,   the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real <NAME/>e,  similar to how we did it in Portland.\u000aUnfortunately,  that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).     Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had,  I never would have left.\u000a\u000aAnyway,  <NAME/> Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within <NAME/> <NAME/> and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.   She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.    However,  I have expressed  to <NAME/> and <NAME/> that my first preference would be to return to Portland.\u000a\u000aI have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.   \u000a I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.     I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aI\u000a

p583
aV\u000a\u000aCongrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     <NAME/> she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  "how is the baby?"   versus "where is the baby?"\u000aBut,  as <NAME/> used to say,  "enough about you,   let's talk about me."   I spoke with <NAME/> B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.\u000a\u000a The HR department here in <NAME/> wants me to entertain other opportunities within <NAME/> and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.   \u000a\u000aAnyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.      \u000a\u000a I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000aI need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:\u000a\u000aFrontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.\u000aThe OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per <NAME/> Patterson.\u000a\u000aThe second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.\u000a\u000a   \u000aHere is the problem:\u000athe head of Ercot Market Operations,  <NAME/> Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.\u000aWe explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.\u000a\u000aI sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  <NAME/> Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   <NAME/> also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    <NAME/> told me "dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHere is my view:\u000aOOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.\u000aErcot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.\u000aIf OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.\u000aOOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.\u000aWhy would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a "breakeven."   Ridiculous.\u000a\u000aI spoke with <NAME/> Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment" on whether OOMC means to generate.  <NAME/> Patterson now also has "no comment."\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/> said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.\u000a\u000aI had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.\u000aErcot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   \u000aWe worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME."\u000aThe Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?\u000a\u000aFinally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to OOME our plant."\u000a\u000aCan I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aBobby,\u000aI came really, really close to coming back to Portland.    I was recently asked to help get the Ercot (TEXAS) region off of the ground by organizing,  training and motivating the Real Time group.   I declined initially, as I had previously turned this job down from Portland.    I came to <NAME/> to trade cash.    Bait and Switch.\u000a  Anyway,  I was looking to return to PDX to work in Mid Mkt or Services, wherever I could have an impact (positive impact, jackie).    \u000aOnce I expressed to <NAME/> that my bags were packed, more opportunity presented itself;   I am going to get experience in managing our assets in Texas.   We have an agreement with Teco to manage a 480 mw combined cycle facility in South Texas.   We have some other interesting arrangements as well.\u000a\u000aI will be working with <NAME/> <NAME/>-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.    Good, solid technical guy.   These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this,  I agreed to finish the rest of the year in <NAME/> and get this thing up and running.    Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.    Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.\u000aI am working with Smith and <NAME/> Miller as well.\u000a\u000aFor all of its sound, fury and ego's the <NAME/> office is actually disorganized and short on morale.    \u000aMy transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.      My gut tells me that if I stay with the company,  I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.\u000a\u000aLet me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.

I though you were saying b/c i agreed with you, you were right\u000aTXsscott5: oh...ha\u000aTXsscott5: people were attacking me...saying, "no amount of water can be bad for you" etc. etc.\u000aTXsscott5: and i replied, "at some point your body can't process the water...the system has to overload"\u000ajoefreid: too much of anything is bad for you....way to overpower them with your tremendous intellect\u000aTXsscott5: ha\u000aTXsscott5: thx\u000aTXsscott5: i think i've scared them all know\u000aTXsscott5: now\u000ajoefreid: Cow them into submission\u000aTXsscott5: i always do....could be why i've heard the words, "you're intimidating" more than once in my lifetime\u000aTXsscott5: oh well....i gotta be me\u000ajoefreid: not necessarily a bad thing....when used in moderation\u000ajoefreid: Law of Diminishing Returns again...it is everywhere\u000aTXsscott5: ha\u000aTXsscott5: so true\u000aTXsscott5: seriously though....i may have issues w/ challenges and/or the gauntlet being thrown down....i hate being wrong, but i'd rather be wrong than not know the correct answer\u000ajoefreid: ...so as long as you can gain the knowledge you are ok?\u000ajoefreid: insatiable intellectual curiosity?\u000aTXsscott5: oh, i'll be a little bitter for a while that i was wrong...but i get over it and then i have the knowledge from there on out...so i come out ahead\u000ajoefreid: ...I am the guy that will look out the airplane window and marvel how the "wing" provides lift.  The physics of it all and who in the world came up with that?\u000aTXsscott5: that one still gets me\u000aTXsscott5: i mean, really....how cool is that\u000aTXsscott5: this giant heap of metal....airborne\u000aTXsscott5: i took the aviation ground course in college as an elective\u000ajoefreid: is it and extrapolation of Bernoulli's Principle\u000ajoefreid: ?\u000aTXsscott5: ok...engineer talking to business major\u000aTXsscott5: heard of the principle...but couldn't define it for you \u000aTXsscott5: ;(\u000aTXsscott5: :-(\u000ajoefreid: i realize the whole greater distance over the top of the wing creates a faster wind velocity above than below the wing and therefore causes a pressure differential (low above, high below and this "lifts" the wing.  But it the newtons of lift is dependent upon the shape of the wing, the airflow over it, etc...\u000aTXsscott5: ok.....i'm officially impressed....my dad could talk to you for HOURS\u000ajoefreid: That is why for the longest time, maybe even still today, the wings are the most difficult aspect of the plane to reproduce.  Other countries would love for Boeing to outsource the construction of the wing so they could learn how to make it.\u000ajoefreid: I'm sure your father would shame me\u000aTXsscott5: no....i doubt, but it would make for some interesting discussion\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust wanted to let you know that I'm flying in Sunday evening for an interview on Monday.  <NAME/> and I are talking about going out to dinner, nothing big, and were wondering if you might have any interest.  Let me know your thoughts and if I don't here back from you via email I'll just try giving you a buzz this weekend.  <NAME/> things are going well.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p616
aV\u000a\u000ahave you been getting my emails?  i gave this address to moscoso and he said it didn't work.\u000a
p617
aV\u000a\u000aHey guys...wanted to see what your availability is for this afternoon.  Also, would you mind emailing the two individuals Wei listed and outline for them exactly what information it is you're hoping to locate.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a
p618
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI don't know if I told you before, but I'm leaving tomorrow for a long weekend in the Caymans with my new group.  I can't tell you how much my life has changed in the last three weeks.  I'm getting out of the office no later than 6:30 everyday (and it's usually closer to 4:30-5:00) and I actually have time to do other things with my life.  I went to the symphony last week, am going to a reception at the MFA next week, joined a volunteer organization geared toward young professionals and am thinking about joining the church I've been going to the last couple of months.  All in all life has improved.  Still nothing new on the guy front, but I'm in no rush so it's not that big a deal.\u000a\u000aI am so excited about my trip out to San <NAME/> to see you.  I promise to be well rested and ready to shop, eat and go out....or just sit on the beach.  Like I said before, I'm up for anything.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> things are going well with you, the job and <NAME/>.  Drop me a line if you get a chance and let me know what's new in your life.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p619
aV\u000a\u000aI decided to go ahead and come in to the office.  You can contact me via this email address or at 713-853-1455.  \u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p620
aV\u000a\u000aok....i'm back at the desk.  just reread your email and realized you're actually working at the cafe tonight...cool.  \u000a\u000aas for the apt., the first really was bound to be more of a meet-and-greet, lay the groundwork situation so maybe it's just as well is was shorter.  next week you'll be able to actually start examining things w/ her a bit more rather than merely establishing a starting point.\u000a\u000ai was reading a bunch of my "With God All Things are Possible" book last night and there was a passage that just totally hit home with me which referenced <NAME/>' reaction to a sinner who approached him.\u000a\u000a"he neither condoned nor condemned the sin, he understood it".....it think this is such an important perspective to gain not only in reacting to those around you but almost more importantly to yourself. (bear in mind that this is primarily me talk'n to me, but i thought you might take something away from it as well)\u000a\u000alike i said, i'm gonna stick around here for a while and then i will, of course, have the cell phone.  \u000a\u000agood luck kick'n the cold.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS - if you need a non-drinking partner at the "annual party" i'm in....\u000a
p621
aV\u000a\u000asmith, pallen and others are talking about a ski-trip ASAP....as in leaving this weekend.  and smith has recommended visiting you in Deer Valley.  just wanted to give you some sort of fore-warning on the matter.  \u000a\u000achat w/ you later, \u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aps - he has also said he may stay longer...eek!\u000a
p622
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'm going to be working on west curve validation...do you have any of the information.  Joe Parks told me to contact you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p623
aV\u000a\u000aQuestion for you....\u000a\u000awhich section of <NAME/> <NAME/> did we think seemed better?  Was is the North streets or the West?  And which side of <NAME/> <NAME/> Ave would i want to be on....I can't remember any of this stuff.\u000a\u000aThanks!\u000a
p624
aV\u000a\u000asusan_m_scott@hotmail.com is the email address....then the name is simply <NAME/>\u000a
p625
aV\u000a\u000aThis is the engineer you wanted me to give a shot...\u000a\u000aLet's bear in mind our initial meeting was before Christmas and I've never agreed to meet him....yet he still persist.\u000a
p626
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSo nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going great for you as well.  I'm actually going <NAME/> Jahnke's wedding that same evening.  Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.  Please tell <NAME/> I say, "hello" and wish he and his new wife the very best.  So when does school start?  And, how are the small businesses going?\u000a\u000aHave a nice time at the wedding,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p627
aV\u000a\u000aI know, I know....she booked the flight right after we all got off the phone.  The final blow, her ticket was about $30 bucks less than mine (Continental is evil).  Oh and by the way, I think she may be on your flight back to H-town on the 12th...maybe you can switch your seats to be next to each other!  Regardless, still think it's going to be fun and the economics definitely improve with more people.  She does want to visit with some of the <NAME/> people so get ready for a cat fight over precious little niklaus.  I figure at least one of the days she's gonna want to see work people so we'll just get some market shopping in then (and don't forget we'll have to escape to discuss my last escapade).  Anyway, like I said...still thinks it's going to be a good trip.  Let me know what you think about the Italy trip after you have a chance to look...<NAME/> and I have both been to Salzburg, but I don't think either of are opposed to going back.  The town is adorable and there are scenic vistas, not to mention sausage and beer.\u000a\u000aCiao,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000acell number is 713-775-6472\u000a\u000asignal is bad in the bldg so if it doesn't come through i'll just call you back.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000athis is becoming somewhat redundant, but thank you.\u000a\u000ahonestly, your endorsement of me with these people means a lot.\u000a
p630
aV\u000a\u000aI'm flying out for Korea tomorrow morning, but give me a call when you get home from your meeting...I'm sure I'll still be packing.\u000a
p631
aV\u000a\u000ahey mo....how's it going?\u000a\u000ahope you had a good day at work today, mine was boring as usual.  just wanted to let you know that i thought i might try to give you a call tonight and fill you in on my plans for seattle.  i really feel like i have no idea how this whole thing will pan out, and i'm getting more nervous as friday approaches.  oh well, c'est la vie right?\u000a\u000ai've been trying to freshen up on things and be a little more on top of my game...but it's tough.\u000a\u000ai've agreed to be out of my apt. by the end of the day Monday...saves me about $250, but then the commute starts...yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000atalk to you later,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p633
aV\u000a\u000aWrong <NAME/> again...try typing sscott3@enron.com (that's her short email address)...mine is sscott5@enron.com.  If you see the middle initial "M" pop up in the address, you've got the wrong <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p634
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>...we're staying at the Mayflower Inn.  I'll give you a call on your cell phone when we get to town.  It may not be until Friday though since our plane gets in late...but I'll call none the less.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p635
aV\u000a\u000aso...talked to emily last night and here's the deal...\u000a\u000ashe left sometime this morning to go to round top for a big antiques fair and will be spending the night in NB tonight....\u000a\u000ano one has talked to katy as of yet to see if she's going to austin this weekend or not.....\u000a\u000aemily talked to matt and he said he was out for doing anything this weekend, but that next weekend would be good...and i think one of emily's pledge sisters and her boyfriend/his friends may try to meet emily in NB next weekend....so it looks like next weekend in NB is a definite gathering....\u000a\u000aas for this weekend....depending on work today, which will suck, i may try to drive to NB tonight and spend the night there...i have a feeling i'm going to be relegated to LOTS of family time on saturday and sunday in austin b/c tons of family/friends are coming to the game this weekend and want to spend time with chris and chuck....therefore, if you want to go to NB as well tonight we could certainly ride up together but i'd check w/ emily about a ride back to h-town b/c there's no telling when i'll get out of there on sunday....\u000a\u000aeither give me a call later or email me back w/ your thoughts...\u000a\u000asue\u000a
p636
aV\u000a\u000aso you can only buy tickets at the Mucky Duck...I may go by right after work to try and get them...Do you want me to just call you on your cell phone and let you know if we've got actual seats?\u000a
p637
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was wondering whether you thought it would be better to fly in Thursday evening or Friday morning.  Honestly, either option would work for me I just wasn't sure if <NAME/> would want to sleep in Friday morning since it's his day off.  Let me know which one sounds better to you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p638
aV\u000a\u000aBecca,\u000a\u000aI am sooooo sorry I'm not going to be able to make the party.  Please give everyone my best and tell Jen I would have done everything within my power to embarass her.  I'm actually going to be in S. Korea visiting my brother and sister-in-law, so I do have a legitimate excuse.\u000a\u000aSee you at the wedding if not before.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p639
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust wanted to drop you a line and let you know how happy I was that we were able to get together for lunch on Saturday.  I really enjoyed meeting you and hearing about your experiences in Seattle thus far.  <NAME/> all is going well with you and that you continue to enjoy your new home.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p640
aV\u000a\u000aI believe this was intended for the other <NAME/> <NAME/> (sscott3@enron.com)...I'm with nat gas trading.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p641
aV\u000a\u000adid you finally talk to him today?\u000a\u000ai'm definitely interested in the movie/dinner (i have a couple things in mind) but it probably won't be till around 8 o'clock or so...if that's ok with you.\u000a
p642
aV\u000a\u000aSorry Mo....certainly didn't mean to bum you out.  I'm a torrent of mixed feelings today.  Between job prospects, my cold and coming to grips with some of the past i've just been a little detached from myself.  I was also in the midst of a taxing conversation with ted when we were IM'ing and it was bringing back stuff too.  I'm just struggling with this pattern of attaching myself to men who are ultimately either literally not available or emotionally not available.  and this whole mm not contacting me has got me very conflicted....b/c to be honest, i really hope he never contacts me again...but i also feel like him not contacting implies that he believes there is something wrong with even our casual interaction (and i'm not disagreeing), which ultimately makes me feel guilty and rotten.  so anyway...i think i just want something to come along that feels good..whether that be a job,a guy,a location, a massage...whatever.  i'm just very disappointed with mediocrity.  i feel luke warm about too many things. \u000a\u000aand the partying comment didn't make me think of us reverting...it merely made me think of mm and a past conversation we had at a point i could have maybe kept things from going too far. \u000a\u000agive me a buzz tonight when you get home...i'll probably feel tons better after a little nourishment.\u000a
p643
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWanted to wish you a Happy New Year, and let you know that I'm Seattle bound one more time.  I have an office visit on the 11th of January so I should be getting in on the 10th and staying through the 13th.  Hopefully you're going to be in town and able to do something during that time.  Let me know how your schedule is looking.  Can't wait to see you again.  Who knows, this could be the precursor to an actual move...eek!\u000a\u000aSee ya,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p644
aV\u000a\u000aI know I've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary.  I can honestly say, I think this is the first time I've been invited to an Aggie happy hour....and to that end, kudos to all those who opted out of <NAME/>'s Boat...you now may be forced to deal with a longhorn interloper.\u000a
p645
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI just wanted to make sure that you had received the email regarding my availability for the week of March 4th.  If you did not, please let me know and I will resend the relevant information.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI believe this was intended for the other <NAME/> <NAME/>.  I'm <NAME/> M. <NAME/> with Nat gas trading.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p648
aV\u000a\u000athat sounds good...don't push yourself to do too much, you need to take it as easy as you can until all of your internships start this summer because you know they're going to be tiring.  plus, you'll be busy introducing me to all of the cute single guys you'll be working with...talk about exhausting!  i'll either chat with you tonight or tomorrow and we can figure out what, if anything, we want to do.  personally, just going a having a good meal coupled with good conversation sounds great to me - nothing big.\u000a
p649
aV\u000a\u000aWell...I would certainly be up for a little travel.  The following locations looked interesting to me.  \u000a\u000aBiarritz, Dinard, Carcassone, Perpignan, St. Etienne or Nimes in France.  Cork, Kerry, Shannon, or Knock in Ireland.  Brussels in Belgium.  Turin, Pisa, Trieste, Venice, Pescara in Italy.  And....Alghero.  However, I'm going home tonight to look in my guide book at all of these places so I'll send you another revised email tomorrow.\u000a\u000aGet back to me when you can and let me know if you have any strong opinions one way or the other.  Obviously, I'm pretty flexible.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p650
aV\u000a\u000aIt's so nice to hear from you!\u000a\u000aActually, we're coming this weekend.  We get in around 10:30 on Thursday night and flight out very late on Sunday.  At present we have reservations at the Mayflower Inn, but are debating taking a trip to the San <NAME/>'s (possibly overnight - do you have an opinion on that?...i.e. can it be just a day trip).  Discovery Park sounds great....we are both very interested in doing as much outdoors as possible.  To that end, we were thinking about doing some kayaking if you know of any particularly good places.  I really hope we get a chance to meet up while I'm in town...you may want to give me your phone number so we can contact you once we're in town.\u000a\u000aThanks again,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p651
aV\u000a\u000aHey Courtney,\u000a\u000aI just wanted to make sure you got my membership check last week.  If you didn't, or if there's anything else I need to do, please let me know.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p652
aV\u000a\u000aI'm sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I would definitely enjoy the opportunity to answer any of your questions about the various opportunities within <NAME/>.  I know what an overwhelming place this can be at times.  I'm actually heading out of the office today for a conference in <NAME/>, but if you want to just email me some questions or pick a time that would be good for you to meet that would be great.\u000a
p653
aV\u000a\u000aem's with the grandparents tonight...so she's out for dinner...said maybe next week.\u000a\u000astill don't know when i'll be getting out of here.\u000a
p654
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust wanted to let you know that I'll be back in Seattle this weekend (tonight - Sunday morn).  Not sure what you're up to, but if our schedules allow it'd be nice to see you again and hang out.  I'm staying at the Claremont downtown and will have my cell phone w/ me (713) 775-6472.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Anyway, the Radney <NAME/> gig is extremely tempting but I really need to see my sister and the kids...depending on what Corey has to say though, I may just go to <NAME/> Sunday and Monday.  We'll see.  Give me a buzz or drop a line if you want to get together.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p661
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aDo I even know this guy, or has someone yet again confused me with the other <NAME/> <NAME/>?  Since your one of the only names on this thing I recognize, besides <NAME/>'s, I thought I'd ask.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I was starting to get worried about you.  Also, we have one of our Taster's dinners Thursday night and both <NAME/> and I are planning on going.  Any interest?\u000a
p664
aV\u000a\u000ayes...but i've decided my hormones are about the equivalent of a 16 yr. old boy's.  we left about 20 mins after you guys and i drove him to his car.  he asked if i minded him calling to ask me out wednesday or thursday of this week as he is going out of town this weekend  (he said he'd tried earlier this year...to which i responded "yes, and failed miserably")  ...we'll see.  he is a cutie though.  i don't know if you'll ever have a chance to look at the picture of you know who, but physically bryan puts him to shame.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000acall me on my cell phone if you get a chance...i'm leaving the office right now.\u000a
p668
aV\u000a\u000adon't have much to pass along....i've been looking into some places to stay if i come up.  i may run a few of the names by you to see what you think or if you know anything about them.  \u000a\u000ai've got to get out of my house SOON!!!  mom woke me up this morning to see if i "needed to get up and start getting ready"....she'd heard my alarm go off and evidently didn't realize my extensive use of the snooze button.  she then followed me out to the car to give me directions on how to drive to work (i.e. which lanes to use...ha)  even though i'd made it just fine the day before.  on the plus side, my meals are being made for me and there is always cheese and crackers.\u000a\u000atalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p669
aV\u000a\u000aActually, I think this may be for you...I see <NAME/> Nicolay's name on the distribution as well and I usually assume emails with her name attached are intended for you.\u000a\u000aLet me know if this isn't the case.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p670
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t decided yet, although I'd like to do dinner...any suggestions?\u000a
p671
aV\u000a\u000asorry didn't check email till today.  things have just been really busy the last month and i've been doing quite a bit of traveling.  i'm out of town this weekend, but maybe next week.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey,\u000a\u000aGood to hear from you.\u000a\u000aCan't say I have too much scoop on Reliant.  Although, I do know a couple of people who work and have worked there and I'd be happy to put you into contact with them if you'd like.\u000a\u000aI'd love to get together while you're in town.  Tomorrow night's probably best for me so either give me a call at work or on my cell phone when you get a chance.\u000a\u000aCiao,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aWork (713) 853-1455\u000aCell   (713) 775-6472\u000a
p674
aV\u000a\u000aSo did you make it in today?  <NAME/> you're feeling better.  Wasn't sure last night if you were or weren't interested in the concert Sat. night.  Let me know because if we decide to go I'm going to buy the tickets today.  Also, Boone called about 11:45 last night to berate you for not returning phone calls or emails.  The message is on the answering machine if you want to call the apartment and listen to it (be forewarned, there is a lot of rambling).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p675
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the <NAME/> desk and Fed-Ex them to the <NAME/> office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  \u000a\u000aBelow is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:\u000a\u000a	-36169000\u000a	-36177000\u000a	-33084000\u000a	-33085000\u000a	-33038000\u000a	-31029000\u000a	-33171000\u000a	-33175000\u000a	-116388\u000a	-903145\u000a	-IT-601\u000a	-41066000\u000a	-41075000\u000a\u000aIf there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.\u000a\u000aThanks for all the help,\u000a
p676
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aNice to hear from you.  I know you just talked to <NAME/> the other day so I got a little more detailed update from her.  I'm sure she told you about our trip over to London...we had a really good time which included me spending a small fortune.  Oh well, money's meant to be spent, right?  Anyway, sounds like you've got some really exciting activities to look forward to over the next 6 mos to a year.  Can't wait to hear all about the baby when it arrives (the first in the family is always exciting) and I know you and <NAME/> are going to have the best time jaunting around Europe.  I wish I was planning the same kind of trip right now.  As for your future beyond that, have you been to Seattle before?  I'm taking a long weekend there with a friend from work and would love to hear more about things to do if you have any advice.  Otherwise, I'll be sure to let you know what I found on my own visit.  <NAME/> things continue to go well for you and we'll have to get together when you come back to Texas...\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p677
aV\u000a\u000aSunil,\u000a\u000aI just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).\u000a\u000aI'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p678
aV\u000a\u000aLupe,\u000a\u000aI found a couple of checks that were for expense reimbursements.  They are past the 90 day period.  What can I do to have these checks reissued?  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a
p679
aV\u000a\u000aHey...if you'd like to try and get together Thursday or Friday let me know.  I think a group is actually getting together Friday night for Ashlea <NAME/>'s birthday, but I'd be willing to skip it (or go if you'd like to see some people).  Anyway, just drop me a note when you get a chance...I could definitely use a good chat session.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p680
aV\u000a\u000aHey Lis,\u000a\u000aHow's married life treating you these days?  I hope things are good with your job, home, etc.  \u000a\u000aI was actually writing you to try and get <NAME/>'s email address.  My friend <NAME/> and I are going to Seattle next week for a long weekend and I was hoping to get some tips from her as well as possibly get together for lunch or dinner.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> to see you soon and please say, "Hi!" to everyone for me next weekend at the lake house.  I'm so sad I'll be missing it, but I'd already booked my flight by the time <NAME/> sent the email.\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p681
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI wanted to touch base with you regarding accommodations.  They last time I came to Seattle I used the following web-site and managed to get a very good deal on my hotel.  http://www.seattlesupersaver.com In the past, I've stayed at both the Westin and Mayflower which seem to be in fairly central locations downtown.  I wasn't sure if you would be making the reservations or if you would prefer that I handle that aspect.  You can either email me back or call me at the office if you would like to discuss any of this in more detail.  My work number is 713-853-1455.\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p682
aV\u000a\u000aJust wanted to say, "thanks gals" for dinner last night.  To be honest with you I had had a pretty bad day and the rest of the week hadn't been much better, but I had a really good time last night....I forget sometimes how nice it is to share so many great memories with old friends.  Not to get too sappy, but I really treasure our friendships and I'm not sure you all realize how much i depend on you guys.  I know it's rarely overt, but I've leaned on the stability and solidness of our friendships on countless occasions and just don't know what I'd do without that safety net to trust in when things are rough.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p683
aV\u000a\u000aback to reality with a vengeance, sometimes reality is no fun...I think the weekend in NB will prove beneficial for you as well so enjoy.  I'm guessing I'll end up at the party despite wanting to go to that concert at the Fabulous Satellite Lounge (I hate having a conscience!)  .\u000a\u000ano contact with the guy...although i think he went home mid-week for a friend's wedding...regardless, though it may not sound like it, i haven't been too focused on the situation.  on a another "playing with fire" note, went and grabbed a couple pints wednesday with dutch (the old boss) and ended up eating dinner with him as well.  he paid (although he tricked me into letting him, said he was charging it to the company so i'd put my money away...needless to say he didn't expense it).  we've always been friends so i guess one outing doesn't hurt, but any future encounters may have to include others for safety reasons.\u000a\u000ai'll see you when you get home.\u000a

p685
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThank you for taking care of all the travel arrangements and interviews.  I look forward to meeting with yourself and the various other members of the Aquila team tomorrow in Kansas City.  The web page links you sent were very informative and certainly gave me a better understanding of Aquila and it's company culture.  I also wanted to let you know that I did complete the on-line application you referenced in your last email.  If there is anything else you need from me, please don't hesitate to ask.\u000a\u000aThanks again,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p686
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI am definitely still interested in the position and will give you a call today between 11:00 and 11:30 PST.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p687
aV\u000a\u000aSee...I told you you were invited.  I think I must have dropped the invitation or something.  Let me know what you think.  I'd been planning on going to the <NAME/> Richey concert Sat night at the Fab Satellite Lounge (along with Corey, <NAME/>, and yourself if you were interested).  Honestly think I'd rather go to the concert, but I would feel somewhat guilty.  What are your thoughts?\u000a
p688
aV\u000a\u000aHey,\u000a\u000aI may swing by the Tasters dinner just to say, "Hi" to everyone and then meet you at the <NAME/> Club.  What do you think of that?  Also, <NAME/> and I may go to Blanco's later if you and <NAME/> have any interest.\u000a\u000aSo I've decided I will have to crash some of your happy hours and try to meet some decent boys.  I'm sick of these crappy ones.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p689
aV\u000a\u000aI was walking with the trader I work for when you called, so it was obviously a little difficult for me to discuss Vegas at the time.  If you get a hankering to talk in the morning you can try me on my cell phone ( midnight - 2 am isn't too late for me, which I think is between 6-8 am your time, right?).  I know this is obnoxious, but I can't talk to <NAME/> about this and I need a co-conspirator.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p690
aV\u000a\u000aHey Lis....\u000a\u000aAs always it's good to hear from you.  I've been meaning to write and ask what you think of the food there (although, obviously you are surviving).  Please tell Priya, "Congratulations!!!!" for me...that is awesome.  I was actually looking into that program the other day, so on a selfish note I'm really curious to see what she thinks of the school, etc.  I think it'd be awesome to work in D.C. (or Boston or Northern California for that matter).  You should definitely keep rolling with the momentum you've got going right now...run with it!  And, good luck trying to arrange the trip w/ Niclas.  If you do manage to go...just have fun (it doesn't have to be "it", it can just be fun).\u000a\u000aI have an offer in KC right now, should be getting the formal offer from Cincinnati next week and still waiting to hear from Chicago.  So things are definitely happening.  I'm just struggling with this decision a bit and have a real tug to head to France or Switzerland for 6 months to become fluent in French (you think I'm kidding, but I've really been checking this stuff out).  \u000a\u000aPart of the reason for my seemingly flaky turn is because of a recent sad event.  <NAME/> went into premature labor on Tuesday (she was about 6 mos along) and the baby didn't make it.  She had a heart beat when she was born, but it was very weak.  They tried to resuscitate her but after about 15 minutes <NAME/> and <NAME/> told the doctors to let her go.  Her name was Kelly <NAME/> <NAME/>.  My Mom and <NAME/>'s Mom flew out to TN on Tuesday and my Dad went out there Wednesday...they are managing, but it's been really tough.  <NAME/> is fine health-wise which we are all very thankful for, but everyone is really just trying to come to grips with why this happened.  So say a little prayer for them if you can.\u000a\u000aI miss you too (you were actually in my dream last night) and really hope you're enjoying yourself.  Take care and I'll talk to you soon.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p691
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.\u000a\u000aI spoke to <NAME/> on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.\u000a\u000aI'll talk to you soon and keep you updated,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBtw...that cute place on 4th Ave in <NAME/> <NAME/> was already rented.\u000a
p692
aV\u000a\u000aI'll work on the jaunt and will do on the limeade's....talk to you tomorrow.\u000a
p693
aV\u000a\u000aI don't know about the seating.  Do you have NCL tonight?  I can't remember if it's Monday or Tuesday.  Anyway, if we got there early enough, say 7:30 or 8:00, I bet we could find somewhere to sit.  Is that something you'd be able to do?\u000a
p694
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI've been given a bit of a reprieve on the deadline.  So, if you could get back to me sometime before this afternoon that would be very helpful.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p695
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was just curious if you had any interest in attending the reception below.  Sounds like it might be interesting to me.  Drop me a line and let me know if it sounds like fun and I'll go ahead and get a couple of tickets.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000a2001 Museum of Fine Arts, <NAME/> Corporate Partners Spring Reception, April 3!\u000a\u000aBe a part of the Museum of Fine Arts, <NAME/> 2001 Corporate Partners Spring Reception on Tuesday, April 3 at Law building of the MFA.  Enjoy great food donated by ARIES Restaurant and The Redwood Grill, free drinks, cool art, and good friends.  To attend or with questions call (713) 639-7585.\u000a
p696
aV\u000a\u000aSo if I can get tickets (actual seats...not standing room only) are you game for tonight?  The concert starts about 8:30 so I figure we would try to get there early enough to get decent seats and possibly eat.  Let me know.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aSorry no call last night...I passed out cold when I got home.  Also, I'm dying to hear about the Jonatha <NAME/> concert.  I had planned on going, but a high school friend's bachelorette party conflicted.  I was really wanting to see <NAME/> Richey...I'm wearing a hole in my CD.\u000a
p697
aV\u000a\u000ayes, that time works fine for me...i was wondering what happened to you.  i had emailed you after you left the message in houston and never heard another peep out of you.  hope things are going well and i'll talk to you around 3ish.\u000a
p698
aV\u000a\u000ahey bonnie!!!\u000a\u000ahow are you doing?  i just had dinner w/ lisa last night and some of the UT girls here in houston.  she's was so excited to hear that we hung out as much as we did last weekend.  I wanted to write and thank you again for being such a gracious host...i had the BEST time hanging out and fell in love with Seattle all over again.  it is truly a fantastic city.  hope all is well with you, and i'm continuing to explore the possibility of joining you and <NAME/> in the <NAME/> City.\u000a\u000ahave a wonderful holiday season,\u000asusan\u000a
p699
aV\u000a\u000aHere you go....<NAME/> wrote me an email and said she'd prefer to eat afterwards ( as would I ), so I say we plan to get to the "reception" around 7:00 and leave for dinner roughly 8:30.  Let me know if that works for you.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.  I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ahey...\u000a\u000athanks for the birthday wish.  i didn't end up doing anything too terribly exciting.  met some friends after work (the monthly dinner group) and then went to pappadeux with mom and grandma.  I had a kitchen shower/luncheon and a bar shower/party saturday in san antonio.  went out friday night with emily till about 2:30 am...perfect NW houston evening, donaraki (sp?) and Matthias's, got up saturday morning at 6am then drove to SA, out until about 3am saturday night, then up and in austin by 11am...brunch with corey then off to kathy and travis's, left austin around 7:30 and got home a little after 10pm...needless to say i'm exhausted today.\u000a\u000aas for the job front....i was 1st runner up for the job with Puget.  they ended up offering it to a guy with more trading experience (go figure, someone with more than 1 yr of experience..ha), had he turned down the offer i would have been packing my bags but unfortunately for me he accepted.  as for ENE, i was offered a position with the new UBS trading organization but decided to decline the offer, i've come to the conclusion that i just need to make a clean break from this place.  i'm actually headed to seattle again this thursday to interview with another natural gas company up there.  it's a small company (around 450) and the job is for a scheduler not a trader, but i've got a good feeling about the place right now.  they strike me as nice people which seems to go a long way these days.  so, i'll arrive thursday evening, interview friday and fly back monday...they said they wanted to give me time to explore the city and look for housing etc., which is nice.\u000a\u000aif all of this works out it looks as though i could be in seattle as early as march...WOW!\u000a\u000ahope all is still going well with you.  i've been so happy to get your emails and know that this experience is turning out to be a good one for you.  \u000a\u000atalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000abtw....i got our deposit back from the apartment complex.  i'll just write you a check for your half and drop it off at your mom's house.\u000a

p704
aV\u000a\u000aI think it's supposed to start around 8:30 and the tickets are either $10 or $15...any interest?\u000a
p705
aV\u000a\u000aIf you email me while I'm out of town, go ahead and sent it to my hotmail account...susan_m_scott@hotmail.com\u000a\u000aI will definitely do my best to make it out there before October.\u000a

p709
aV\u000a\u000aAre you still alive?  I'm just checking b/c I haven't heard a peep out of you in a while.  Drop me a line and let me know what's up.\u000a
p710
aV\u000a\u000aActually, I think the PWC guys will be contacting you to talk about the information they're hoping to locate.  I believe we're going to try to meet with Wei Hu this afternoon to discuss primary and secondary curve mapping/tables.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a
p711
aV\u000a\u000aYes...except I'm sure it will take six more months before they have all of the information changed in the system.\u000a

p714
aV\u000a\u000aHey stranger,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'t talked to you in while, how are things going?  The trip was absolutely incredible.  We went scuba diving, swam with stingrays and drank enough (rum for me personally) to drown a large school of fish.  \u000a\u000aAnyway, I've decided I'm a no go for <NAME/> this Thursday night.  I'm already exhausted and Jen Bowles offered to drive Friday morning so I've decided to take her up on the offer.  After the Caymans last weekend, <NAME/>'s wedding this weekend and San <NAME/> next weekend I've decided my best move is to try and conserve some energy.  Regardless, I will see you and <NAME/> Saturday night and we'll do our catching up then.  My parents are coming to the wedding as well so I'm sure they'll want to have a nice chat with you and <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Law Review isn't wearing you too thin.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI've been having some difficulty accessing my Hotmail account and therefore have been unable to check for your response to my last email.  If you don't mind, could you resend the response to this email account.  Look forward to speaking with you again soon.\u000a\u000aThank you and Happy New Year,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p716
aV\u000a\u000ahey i'm back at the office now....and if you're going to be back at 3:00 my time i'll just stick around.  glad to here things went well.  i'm running to the loo, i'll be back in a few minutes if you're still there...\u000a

p721
aV\u000a\u000aLooks like this visit to Seattle is going to be a quick trip this time.  I fly in Sunday (yes, this Sunday) and fly back out after my interview on Monday.  Maybe we could grab dinner Sunday night...that is if you're free of course.  We could even see what <NAME/>'s up to.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p722
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCould you send in a request for Unify and Dart for me?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p723
aV\u000a\u000ahey....just an fyi, we talked last night...conversation took less than 5 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said, or not said if that makes any sense.  anyway, i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead.\u000a\u000a.....the guy actually said that he was "bummed"....that choice of words did wonders for me....i mean, you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal....it's just not enough that someone be "bummed" by the prospect of never being with me again.\u000a\u000atalk to you later, \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p724
aV\u000a\u000aCaycie,\u000a\u000aThat's great.  I look forward to the day.  By the way, are you coming in town this weekend for <NAME/>'s wedding?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p726
aV\u000a\u000aHi Shannon,\u000a\u000aCould you be sure to remove my name from the distribution and replace it with <NAME/> Huan...he has taken over my roll running the options book. \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p727
aV\u000a\u000aThere's a song both you and <NAME/> are currently playing with the following lyrics..."and now I know for the first time too, all of the ways I've been lying to you.  It's not that I don't think we can't open up in time, it's just that I'm afraid of what we'll find."  Could you enlighten me as to the artist's name?  I keep forgetting to write it down.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p728
aV\u000a\u000ahere's the deal on the arm:\u000a\u000ajust got bk from france late mon night- had\u000alots of fun, race was ok, but looooong.  triped on harry potter's cape and\u000ahad to go in ambulance to emergency room to get x-rays on my arm at the\u000afinish line.  quel surpris- sustain injury to my arm while running a\u000amarathon.  \u000a\u000aas for tomorrow...talked to Em this morning and she's on her way to NB to meet with the tile people.  said she'd be back either late tonight or early tomorrow morning.  as for tomorrow night, she's waiting to see about grandparents, etc. but may be able to meet if it's early....she's supposed to give me a call later so i'll let her know about the colina's thing\u000a\u000asue\u000a
p729
aV\u000a\u000aOk folks...Thursday it is.  My only questions are:  Do we want to do dinner? And if so, what time?\u000a\u000aIf no dinner then we can just pick someplace relatively low key to hang out and chat...Sorry <NAME/>, no downtown clubbing for you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p730
aV\u000a\u000aNone as of yet...so are you just going to let the party people know tomorrow or what?...I figured from your last email you were a lock.  As for myself, I'm still  waiting to hear back from Corey about the concert, so I don't know what I'm doing yet either.  I would love to go to dinner with the crew and then transition to the concert but I don't think the times exactly work out.  Anything in the hopper for this evening?\u000a
p731
aV\u000a\u000aIt happens to me pretty regularly.\u000a\u000aTime:  Yesterday around 4:30 pm\u000a\u000aConversation:\u000a\u000aHim:	yo\u000aMe:	hey\u000aHim:	guess what\u000aMe:	what\u000aHim:	i'm an engaged man\u000aHim:	that kind of came out of nowhere huh\u000a\u000aThere was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.\u000a\u000aSo are you heading up to <NAME/> today? \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p732
aV\u000a\u000aI am genuinely flattered that you are asking for my reading recommendations (not to mention being associated in any way, shape or form with <NAME/> - How is <NAME/> by the way?)  Truth be told, however, of late much of my reading material has been natural gas related and although the industry is riveting, I'm not sure that is exactly the kind of entertainment you had in mind.  However, I did read a book a few months ago that you might find rather interesting.  The title is The Professor and the Madman : A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  I know it may sound a little dry at first glance, but I actually found it extremely interesting.  If you go to Amazon.com there are reviews on all of the books I've included here.  There are also a couple of other books I'm in the process of reading right now:  Galileo's Daughter : A Historical Memoir of Science, <NAME/>, and Love and <NAME/> of Aquitaine : A Life.  The Galileo book is a little slow to start, but has tons of interesting historical references, as does <NAME/> of Aquitaine.  If I remember correctly, you always had a bit of a fondness for history.  I also read Memoirs of a Geisha last fall and couldn't put it down, although I have talked to others who didn't find it as enjoyable.  Personally, I was completely intrigued by the time period and uniqueness of Eastern culture, and the author was meticulous when it came to research for the book.\u000a<NAME/> this helps you out a bit.  As for the "Peacers" comment...Definitely think we are tested, but I think the tests are there to force us to recognize our own strength and endurance.  Contrary to God not knowing anything about us, I'm convinced he knows everything about us and has the unique ability to know when we've lost sight of our talents, character and/or zest for life.  It is at these moments life seems to hand us the upsets right?  But, in dealing with the upsets we come to a better understanding of who we are and what we have to offer the world (or on a much smaller scale, what we have to offer the people around us for whom we care the most).  Sorry, I know I'm getting excessively deep, but I've been doing a heck of a lot of thinking lately - and much of it at church.\u000aDisappointed you won't be able to join the gang in <NAME/> over the fourth, but we'll be sure to raise our glasses in a toast to you.  And, I'll keep looking for you name on the <NAME/> Field scoreboard.\u000aLater,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p733
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>...\u000a\u000aIf you're on the computer could you log into AOL.  I don't have a phone near me to call you on, we need to go over these curves.\u000a
p734
aV\u000a\u000aI actually think we have the Monday off (Sept. 3).  So, ideally I'd fly in Friday evening and fly out Monday afternoon.  I'll email more later, but just thought I'd give you a heads up.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p735
aV\u000a\u000aI believe this was intended for the <NAME/> <NAME/> with ETS...I'm with Nat Gas Trading.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p736
aV\u000a\u000aI have to be in S.A. on the 6th for <NAME/>'s bridesmaid's luncheon...So I was thinking, what if I came up to <NAME/> Thursday night and we made a trip to the Saxon Pub.  Just a thought.  If you have exams, papers, etc. that will be consuming you that week disregard the suggestion, but if not it could be fun.  <NAME/> you're having a good day and that you finished your Note to your satisfaction.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMom must be at it again....\u000a\u000acareer meter:\u000aYou find out late this week that your suspicions were right on. You've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart, and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions. It may be time to take flight and move in a different, more fulfilling direction.\u000a\u000alove meter:\u000aYou feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week, mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts. It's liberating knowing where you stand.\u000aweekly horoscope:\u000aFor February 4-10: A loved one may make a momentous choice, once Saturn and Mercury move direct. This could happen as early as this weekend, but may take longer. The point is that your life, circumstances, and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice. Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is. <NAME/>'t be afraid. For some time, you've known things were not right -- and something had to give. Be very cautious about who you confide in. At this point, the walls have ears. As you establish a new chapter in your life, play your cards very close to your vest. \u000aThought you might enjoy.....\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aDo you know if <NAME/> did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSorry no response from me, I've been out of the country.  Being a novice, I forgot to look at the clock exactly when I crossed.  I know it was 30 mins and some odd seconds, so my best guess is 30.10 minutes  <NAME/> this helps.\u000a
p742
aV\u000a\u000aHey,\u000a\u000aJust remembered that Cory Morrow is playing at the Firehouse Friday night and <NAME/> Temple is going to be at the Mucky Duck.  If you have any interest in doing something Friday let me know.  Maybe we could grab dinner and go see one of these guys play.  I figure you'll be shopping and jaunting around town all day Saturday with Mom, and Sunday is Mother's day...so Friday seems like the best day to get together.  Either email me when you get a chance or just give me a call sometime this week and let me know if any of this sounds good to you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aGot your message last night and since both nights work for <NAME/> and myself we figured we'd leave the decision up to the more finicky <NAME/>.  \u000a\u000aSo <NAME/>, it's all up to you...will it be Thursday or Friday?  If you're looking for a preference from <NAME/> or myself I think we would both be leaning more towards Thursday.  So just shoot us all back an email and let us know when.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to catch up with you <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aSee ya this week,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ai sustained injuries from friday night....two minor scratches on my index finger due to the cat, and a sore neck from head banging to limp bizkit....think mo suffered from the neck injury as well....hope your roomie wasn't irritated by the ruckus.\u000a

p748
aV\u000a\u000aI think some relaxation time is definitely in order for you...so don't worry about tomorrow.  If you're in we can just try and buy tickets there, and if you're out I'll go to the bachelorette party...easy peasy.  Considering you start this whole ride over again on Monday, I would totally understand you wanting to bail out. Whatever you decide PLEASE do not worry about me...I am the epitome of flexible these days.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ahey holly,\u000a\u000ajust wanted to let you know that i'll be in seattle again this weekend.  i'm coming up for a second interview with cascade natural gas.  i fly in thursday evening and leave monday, so if you're in town we'll have to get together some night.  hope all is well and i'll talk to you soon.\u000a\u000asusan\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSo do you have any ideas/plans for brunch on Sunday...my guess is there are a ton of places with special <NAME/> Brunches.  I just thought maybe you had a regular spot.  Let me know.\u000a
p751
aV\u000a\u000aHi Mrs. Barker,\u000a\u000aSorry it's taken me so long to respond regarding the party Saturday (<NAME/> and I only got back into town a couple days ago from visiting <NAME/> in London).  I had actually already purchased concert tickets for Saturday night, but am currently seeing if I can find anyone willing to buy them from me.  If I am successful in pawning these things off I will be present and accounted for to help Kelly and the gang celebrate.  I will be sure to take your number home with me and give you a call tomorrow to let you know my status either way.\u000a\u000aThanks again for everything,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI will be staying at the office later than I initially anticipated this evening.  If you are able to talk simply let me know the time and I will give you a call.\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIf you pull the Curves up under Pub Names you should be able to tell if the have any Omicrons attached to them on the Erms side...if the do, then you have to talk to Nilay Basu to make sure they are mapped on the Germs side...if they don't, then you'll have to attach an omicron and then speak with Nilay.  I can swing by later if you'd like me to explain in a little more detail.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aso this was my quote of the day.....\u000a\u000aOur chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could\u000abe. -<NAME/> <NAME/> <NAME/>, writer and philosopher (1803-1882)\u000a\u000a\u000awow, huh?\u000a\u000aanyway, got your email with the articles for wahso...going to read them right now.  looks like i may be moving tomorrow, so i'll let you know what the future holds for me when i have a better idea. \u000a\u000amore importantly, i wanted to tell you how proud i am of you.  not only for striking out to park city on your own, but also for making the impression you obviously have on the people with whom you work.  it's often hard to see when you are the person in question, but i can tell you from my perspective that the people you work & associate with think very highly of you.  and, i'm thrilled that windy ridge vocalized their appreciation of you and your skills...definitely something you deserved to hear.  it is a great gift to be a person others have confidence in and want to be around, and those are qualities that you possess without question. \u000a\u000adriving into work this morning my sister called on the cell phone, said she had a special message for me...then mack and sally got on the phone and they sang happy birthday to me...i'm such a sap i couldn't help but to start tearing-up.  after they hung up i took a moment to examine where i am in my life right now, and i'm happy to report that i am pleased.  i tried to imagine my emotions had i decided to stay on w/ the group and i don't think my optimism would be nearly so great.  my point is this, sometimes not knowing exactly what the future holds frees you to imagine and dream of things you normally wouldn't.  so to you i say, the sky is the limit....dream, imagine, explore.  we are both going to do great things in and with our lives.  but what i think we need to realize is the scale of those things may be smaller (or even grander) than we'd imagined...point being,  we just need to try and be aware of those opportunities which come along every day that afford us those great moments be they large or small.\u000a\u000acheers!\u000a\u000asuebob\u000a
p756
aV\u000a\u000alook at you...such a hoax spreader...ha\u000a\u000aanyway, i was so busy yesterday i didn't have a chance to do anything about it anyway. so no harm, no foul.  how are you doing?  as for <NAME/>, as you well know our stock's not doing so great these days, but i'm not overly stressed...we are still a sound company and shouldn't have any difficulty rebounding from this to a certain extent....i'm actually thinking about buying in to a greater extent at these levels.\u000a\u000acan't wait to hear how your preparations are coming along...for the wedding and the move.  btw, have you set a firm date yet?\u000a\u000atalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p757
aV\u000a\u000ajust an fyi...\u000a\u000ait's about 4:15 houston time and i'm planning on being at the office for a while (like maybe a couple more hours)...so, if you wanted to track me down i'd try here first.  i'm studying...ha.\u000a
p758
aV\u000a\u000aHey Em,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet.  I just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset (aside from getting physically ill at Teala's Friday night...it was ugly).  <NAME/> emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.  When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.  They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.  To top everything off, he's moving back to <NAME/> in three weeks...ughh.  Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.  Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.\u000a\u000aTa for now,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p759
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aJust wondering if you had any preferences regarding the spa times I emailed you yesterday.  If you get a chance let me know and I will go ahead and make a reservation.\u000a\u000aCiao,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p760
aV\u000a\u000aHi Wei, \u000a\u000aThe PWC guys said that 1:30 would be fine.  I have also asked them to email <NAME/> and Bjorn with their requests.  If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.  What is your location again?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p761
aV\u000a\u000ahey sarah,\u000a\u000athanks for the update...i was going to let you know that i'm heading out to my parents tonight to help decorate the Christmas tree, but maybe i can come by one day this week to check out the house.  just let me know what day or days would work best for you.\u000a\u000athanks again for thinking of me,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p762
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI apologize for not returning your call sooner, but I was actually out of town until yesterday.  If you could drop me an email and let me know what would be the best time call you I would really appreciate it.\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p763
aV\u000a\u000aI'm sure it is...I'll just keep forwarding the emails to you as I get them.  However, I will warn you that I'm on vacation from the 14th-26th of August.  I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in S. Korea so it should be interesting.  Anyway, you may want to give a heads up to people to make sure they're sending the information to the right person.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> M. <NAME/>\u000a
p764
aV\u000a\u000aNo problem...and you still need to see the Yankee Doodle Dandy movie, very patriotic and especially poignant for an independence day baby.  As for gas trading land, things are good.  Everyday I become a little more comfortable with the region I'm trading as well as the ins and outs of the pipeline and storage systems.  Sorry to hear about the ag group's demise, but I'm guessing there are some great opportunities to be had on the weather desk so congratulations are in order (as usual you have landed on your feet).  What's <NAME/> going to be up to as a result of this?  \u000a\u000aAnyway, glad you got in some vacation time before the move and as luck would have it over your birthday.  Did you make it back to Cali or head to your new second home, <NAME/>?  I'm assuming the book you are referring to is Market Wizards...I haven't read it yet, but have heard much about it from some of the other traders on the desk.  Maybe I should give it a look, if only to see what kind of things I'll need to write about once I join that circle...attitude is key.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p765
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI wanted to thank you for including <NAME/> and myself Saturday night...we both had a great time.  It actually meant a lot to me to have such a fun evening w/ almost total strangers, makes the prospect of moving up there a little less daunting.  You have a nice group of friends, and I will definitely draw on both yours and their expertise on where to live, etc. should I end up moving.  Hopefully I will know some more in a week or so...and when I do I will definitely give you a shout and let you know how things are playing out.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p766
aV\u000a\u000ahey lisa,\u000a\u000ai looked in my car and couldn't find your dress, so i'm pretty sure you took it inside your parent's house saturday night...where you put it once inside i have absolutely no idea.  good luck tracking it down and thanks again for letting me stay at your folks, i really slept like a log on that bed.\u000a\u000asusan\u000a
p767
aV\u000a\u000aplease call...will be leaving in about 15-20 mins. so disregard phone message and call around 11:40 your time.\u000a
p768
aV\u000a\u000aNo problem...I'll give you a buzz if they show up at my desk.\u000a
p769
aV\u000a\u000aVegas trip was pretty interesting.  Give me a call tonight if you get a chance.  Try the cell phone any time after 4:30 (<NAME/> time) - \u000a(713) 775-6472.\u000a\u000aIf I'd spent any longer  than three days in that town I'd be dead right now.  I think the earliest I made it back to my room was around 6:45 am.\u000a
p770
aV\u000a\u000aI actually do know that girl...helped recruit her a year or so ago.  She always seemed nice to me and normal, but I'll ask around and see what I turn up.  Yes, I am still coming over there.  I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.  Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.  I really want to try and get together while I'm there.  I may be going elsewhere the 6th thru the 9th (my friend, <NAME/>, wants to take a little trip somewhere) but I will definitely be in town Saturday night through Monday...let me know.\u000a\u000aI was very excited to hear about Caycie too.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p771
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI am no longer the book admin handling the trader referenced by the deal below.  I have taken the liberty of forwarding this email to the individual now running the book in question.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a                  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThe deal which needs to be changed is highlighted and bolded in red below.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p772
aV\u000a\u000aHad a bit of an encounter with <NAME/> last night.  Turns out it wasn't as bad as I thought it was based upon the email below.  Start from the bottom and work your way up.  FYI he's kidding about the MD (managing director) and God comments.\u000a
p773
aV\u000a\u000aI will be staying at the office later than I initially anticipated this evening.  If either of you are able to talk simply let me know the time and I will give you a call.\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p774
aV\u000a\u000aDid you get that <NAME/>?  Just kidding....I'll see you guys at the apartment.\u000a
p775
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.  My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.  Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a
p776
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI just wanted to check up on you and see how the trip to New York went.  Las Vegas was way too much fun...so much so it's quite possible I did permanent damage.  I managed to stay in town this weekend though and catch up on some much needed sleep and organizing.  <NAME/> everything's good with you and I'll talk to you soon.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p777
aV\u000a\u000ahey holly,\u000a\u000ajust wanted to see what's going on with you, and to inquire how the long weekend in whistler went...i'm curious to hear how everything played out.  also, bonnie wanted to get the name of the guy you knew who's based down in tacoma and went to west point.\u000a\u000adrop me a line when you get a chance.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p778
aV\u000a\u000ahey <NAME/>...couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you or not.\u000a\u000aP00500873\u000apswd:  temple\u000a
p779
aV\u000a\u000aHi Ivonne,\u000a\u000aI opened up new bank accounts recently and need to set up direct deposit for my pay checks and expense reports.  Could you let me know what all I need to do to have this set up?  I have already filled out the form available on eHRonline.com.  If you could either email me with the instructions or call at ext. 31455 I would appreciate it.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p780
aV\u000a\u000ano offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect...just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response.\u000a\u000aand, though i don't think you intended to, please don't EVER imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid...not in my nature\u000a
p781
aV\u000a\u000aHey Corey,\u000a\u000aWas wondering if you and <NAME/> still had any interest in the Concert Sat. night.  Drop me a line and let me know if you want to go ahead and buy tickets (they're $15 a piece).  The box office opens at 8:00 and doors open at 9:00, but the last time I went there there was a line to get in by 8:45...I would recommend showing up around 8:15 or so to make sure you get a seat inside.  Still trying to figure out how guilty I'd feel missing this bachelorette party...\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p782
aV\u000a\u000aLast night was good...a nice, relaxed dinner suited me just right.  As for a rematch, we'll see...I've got dinner with <NAME/> and <NAME/> (you met her downtown once I think) tonight.  So maybe Thursday or Friday night we could do something.  I'll give you a call later.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s email address is julieg@qualcomm.com\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p783
aV\u000a\u000aYou added sscott5, not sscott3, to the list...I'm with natural gas trading.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> M. <NAME/>\u000a
p784
aV\u000a\u000aWould love to get together again sometime, but I'll think I'll let someone else take over as far as the shot contests go...I was the champ - though ultimately of what I'm not sure.  Frightening as it is I felt fine on Saturday, however from what I've heard that wasn't exactly the case with Bass.\u000a\u000aThanks again,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a(You'll probably be receiving words of gratitude from me for a while to come)\u000a
p785
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI keep receiving this message and am uncertain of exactly what it is they need me to do.  Could you take a look at it and fill me in on what action I need to take?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p786
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI just wanted to check in and see how you are doing these days, and more importantly where you are?  I'm still at <NAME/> right now working for the "estate".  I've been interviewing and have a few offers, but am not completely sure what I will be doing.  <NAME/> all is well with you and I'd love to hear what is going on in your life.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p787
aV\u000a\u000ahere's the web-site address for the restaurant\u000a\u000awww.fscotts.com/\u000a\u000ai think the wine we had was Eberle-Syrah\u000a
p788
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you had fun yesterday...I was actually writing to see if you had any interest in going to <NAME/> this weekend.  <NAME/>, <NAME/>, myself and possibly <NAME/> are talking about making a trip up there tomorrow.  We would be going out with some guy friends of ours so if <NAME/> wanted to come he wouldn't be completely outnumbered.  Also, one of <NAME/>'s friends manages <NAME/> Green and he's playing at Gruene Hall so we were thinking about trying to go see him on Saturday.  Drop me a line and let me know if you have any interest.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p789
aV\u000a\u000aforgot to tell you....\u000a\u000atalked to <NAME/> Bagwell yesterday and...she and <NAME/> got engaged on the 28th.  she's very excited and sounded genuinely happy.  just thought i'd fill you in some good news.  and, yes, i do think it's a good thing.\u000a\u000aalso, i'm sure tori sent you an email...but, yesterday was her last day w/ ENE.  i'm truly thrilled for her too.  i think this is going to be a very good thing.  \u000a\u000ahasta\u000a
p790
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>....\u000a\u000aI'm probably going to have to head out this evening.  I'll call you on your cell phone to let you know if I'll be able to make dinner or not.  Can't wait to see you guys.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p791
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aOk, first the bad news...I can't come up President's weekend for the Whistler trip.  Now the good news, I'm going to be in Seattle next weekend.  I'm coming to have a 2nd round interview with Cascade Natural Gas (whose headquarters is actually right around downtown - looks like maybe Belltown).  Anyway, I fly in Thursday and don't leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday, much like my set-up last time.  So, if you're going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I'm really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p792
aV\u000a\u000aSorry I didn't call this weekend, but I was swamped Saturday and subsequently exhausted on Sunday.  I basically rotated from my bed to the couch to the pool to the couch and back to bed.  Pitiful but much needed.  Anyway, I was just going to tell you to go ahead and buy the ticket for me.  Departing the 14th and returning the 26th...which I believe puts me into Seoul Wednesday night and departing on a Sunday.  You can either call or email if you have any questions for me.  And, I'll decide where I'd like to go for the long weekend.  I may pick two and just let you two decide the final destination.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p793
aV\u000a\u000aHe was over again last night.  Please explain to me why you would invite your "man" over to your apartment when you have a roommate and he lives alone.  I simply do not understand.  I took full advantage of the fact <NAME/> lived alone...we never hung out at my apartment.  Where's the fun in that?  I just think it's weird.\u000a\u000aTalk to you later,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p794
aV\u000a\u000aHit really close to home for my particular tribe.....\u000a
p795
aV\u000a\u000aDidn't you know....I hold the title of Ms. <NAME/>.\u000a
p796
aV\u000a\u000aHey Corey,\u000a\u000aI'm thinking about driving to <NAME/> this weekend to see <NAME/> & <NAME/>'s new house as well as the two of them and the kids.  Just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together.  I know you still have to work at the Law Review, but I figure you won't be there 24 hrs. a day...course I could be wrong.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p797
aV\u000a\u000aHey,\u000a\u000aJust wanted to make sure you're still up for the MFA reception tomorrow night.  I told <NAME/> about it last night and she said she'd like to go as well.  So...the reception is supposed to start at 7:00 and go until 9:00 and I figured we could either go to an early dinner, or cut out of the reception a little bit early and go to dinner afterward (say around 8:00 - 8:30).  Of course, dinner doesn't have to factor in at all if we don't want it to...just a suggestion.  I'll give you call later tonight to hammer out the details.\u000a\u000aSee ya,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p798
aV\u000a\u000aMarion,\u000a\u000aI apologize for not returning your call last night.  I was out to dinner when you rang and by the time I returned home it seemed too late to call back.  You should be able to reach me today without any problems.  If you would like, you could also just shoot me an email with a time you would prefer to talk and I could phone you.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p799
aV\u000a\u000aI believe this was intended for the other <NAME/> <NAME/>...I'm with Nat Gas trading.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p800
aV\u000a\u000aThere is only one <NAME/> <NAME/> at <NAME/> that really matters, right?  Best ways to ensure it's me...either use sscott5@enron.com or check to make sure the middle initial that pops up is "M".  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p801
aV\u000a\u000alooks like the festivities start around 9:30 or so...which is probably when I'll get there.  I will of course have the cell phone in tow if you just want to call after your dinner.  maybe tonight will actually work and we can get a much needed live music fix.\u000a
p802
aV\u000a\u000athought you'd find this interesting.....\u000a\u000achrysalis (KRIS-uh-lis) noun, plural chrysalises or chrysalides (kri-SAL-i-deez)\u000a\u000a   A pupa of a moth or butterfly, enclosed in a cocoon.\u000a\u000a[From Latin chrysallis, from Greek.]\u000a\u000a   "The climax of metamorphosis into an adult can be viewed almost daily.\u000a   Butterflies usually emerge from their chrysalises sometime between 9:30\u000a   a.m. and 11:30 a.m."\u000a   <NAME/> <NAME/>, Where Beauty Flutters By, The St. <NAME/> Post-Dispatch,\u000a   Jul 23, 1995.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey folks,\u000a\u000aIt's harassment time.  I'm trying to put together the contact list to end all contact lists.  I was hoping you guys could help me out by filling in any of the info you may already have.  I've attached an excel file which has plants, pipelines and storage facilities.  Fill in whatever you can and feel free to add anything you think should be included.  Just take a look at the sheet when you get a chance and let me know if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks for all the help,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p804
aV\u000a\u000aeventually...may go to the museum after work, but it closes at 7:00 so won't be back any later than 7:30 or so.\u000a
p805
aV\u000a\u000ahaven't tried...will do so now...i am on msngr as well (AOL, MSN, Yahoo!...take your pick)\u000a
p806
aV\u000a\u000aI would definitely be up for tonight and a walk sounds great.  I just need to swing by the grocery store and the dry cleaners after work, so 6'ish is probably best for me.  Let me know if that works for you and also where you'd like to meet/walk.  <NAME/>, if there's a good place around your duplex I'd love to come see it and show you the pictures I took from your wedding...there's a great one of you and <NAME/> dancing at the reception.  Anyway, drop me a line and we'll figure out when and where to meet.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ahey lis....\u000a\u000ai'm sorry i was late last night and not in full party mode, i too was in a bit of a mood.  anyway, was going to see if you wanted anything special for dinner tonight.  i thought maybe i could cook something and that we could do presents etc while watching the ever popular felicity.  let me know how your day is looking and if there is anything i can prepare/pick up tonight that strikes your fancy....i'd be happy to grab berry-hill as well if that would hit the spot.\u000a\u000asue\u000a\u000aHappy Birthday again!!!\u000a
p809
aV\u000a\u000ahey...how's it going?\u000a\u000asorry i've haven't emailed in so long...things have been busy.  btw, matt did decide to take the job with UBS.\u000a\u000aas for myself, i went back up to seattle last weekend for an interview with the other company i'd talked to up there.  they ended up offering the job so i'm in the process of deciding whether or not i want to take it...i have until the end of the month to make up my mind.  meanwhile, i'm checking out a bunch of other possibilities and seeing what turns up.  living at home has been interesting.  mom still insists on waking me up personally in the morning and harassing me at every turn.  still, the meals are great and it's kind of nice to be at home right now.\u000a\u000ai'm flying to tennessee today to visit chuck and chris...i'm very excited to see their house and the area.  i'll be there through monday and then work on planning my next trip...ha.  also, some other exciting news - kathy and travis are pregnant with their third!!!  babies galore in the scott clan...that is, of course, except for me.\u000a\u000atalk to you soon,\u000asusan\u000a\u000athe pictures you took were great...can't wait to see more.  take care.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aget online (msngr) if you get a chance...i'm still at work.\u000a
p811
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s already left for the day so you'll probably have to get with him first thing tomorrow morning to get his bid.  I'll be sure to let him know about the deal if he calls to check in today or first thing tomorrow morning if I don't talk to him before then.  \u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p812
aV\u000a\u000aunfortunate...but you also don't want to go getting yourself attached to someone whom you ultimately don't have enough in common with to sustain the kind of relationship you're looking for.\u000a\u000aoff the soapbox....\u000a\u000ai'm going to the grocery store (forgot some things), the dry cleaners, running and finishing up laundry detail...so that will take up a bit of time.\u000a
p813
aV\u000a\u000aPlease don't send me any more compression services emails.  I have nothing to do with any of the information below and should probably not even have access to it...the <NAME/> <NAME/> you're looking for does not have the middle initial M.  There is no middle initial shown for her in the system.\u000a\u000aThank you\u000a
p814
aV\u000a\u000aThere is only one <NAME/> <NAME/> at <NAME/> that really matters, right?  Best ways to ensure it's me...either use sscott5@enron.com or check to make sure the middle initial that pops up is "M".  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p815
aV\u000a\u000aSorry we didn't get much of a chance to chat last night, but I hope you had fun at steak night.  It's too bad you didn't make it to <NAME/>'s ( you could have seen a true dancing display by yours truly).\u000a
p816
aV\u000a\u000aAs usual <NAME/>, I am left somewhat disturbed by your words...and by the way, do you ever return phone calls?  As for the rest of you guys, I anxiously await our impending reunion in Cap City.  Glad to hear everyone seems to be doing okay, with the exception of <NAME/> who appears to be suffering from a severe case of spring fever.  <NAME/> <NAME/>, went to an Astros game a couple weeks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special.  The trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats regularly...seems you're not doing to shabby.  Congrats.  Life for me is pretty good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation regarding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to said discussion when we convene).  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but things just seem to be getting less certain the older I get.  <NAME/>'t want to get to heavy now...so I'll saw the really bleak stuff for <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aCiao,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p817
aV\u000a\u000aI've got an opinion now...I think we should fly into Brescia (Italy).  We could fly in and cab it to Brenzone.  It's on one of those amazing lakes in northern Italy (Lago di Garda).  You can go to Gardaworld.com and then just click on photo gallery and Brenzone to see what it looks like...absolutely amazing.  It would be a fantastic trip in my opinion - Lots of great wine.  Plus, you can be the exchange rate from Pounds or Dollars to Lire.\u000a
p818
aV\u000a\u000athat's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/ <NAME/>'s toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....\u000a\u000abtw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.\u000a\u000ayou were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aSorry I was in such a funk last night, I'm not really sure why but I assume it will pass soon.  Anyway, got an email from <NAME/> this morning and she said another trip should be planned to go over in Sept/Oct when the airfares are dirt cheap.  I'm guessing I'll probably be up for going again by that time if you don't mind waiting that long.  My guess is we could get tickets for somewhere around $350 or $400.  I think I found a flight for June (probably the 5th - 12th), but I'm going to end up spending somewhere around $600.  Let me know what you think.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p822
aV\u000a\u000aDisregard the last bit of the previous email...I tracked down a ride.\u000a
p823
aV\u000a\u000aMy mom told me about Tootsie when we got home...I am so sorry.  I know how much those dogs mean to you...as do most Londoners based on the picture arsenal.  Anyway, I'm sure the funk will last for a while, but eventually you'll start to feel better.  Just take the long weekend to relax and recoup from the news (and doctor prodding)...we'll grab a margarita next week sometime.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p824
aV\u000a\u000aIt all sounds pretty good, but is there any way to get on an earlier flight Sunday?  Probably not, I know there are only a few flights out a day, but if I could get into <NAME/> closer to late afternoon on Sunday it would be a better for me.  I'd really like to stay that Saturday night...so if worse comes to worse, I'll just deal with the jet lag.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p825
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI keep getting this invoicing message, could you run me through getting this resolved.\u000a\u000aThanks, \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p826
aV\u000a\u000aGoing to hear some live music tonight at <NAME/> Electro's Blues Jam in the Heights...excited to try something different.  However, I am ditching Kates, Lis, and <NAME/> J. so mums the word.  Just don't feel like having a dinner filled with cotton candy chat.\u000a
p827
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHow are you doing?  <NAME/> said you'd broken your foot recently and have been stuck on crutches...which I'm guessing is no fun when you're riding public transportation.  Anyway, I was writing to see if you might have some suggestions of things to do and places to go while in Seattle.  One of my co-workers and myself are flying up Thursday for a long weekend in your fair city and were hoping to get a few pointers.  I hope you're still enjoying things as much as you were a few months ago.  It looks like you may have changed jobs already, which I trust is a good thing for you.  I'm very anxious to see the city and all it has to offer...there is a part of me that has always thought I'd like to live in the Pacific Northwest for a while (so this will be a little bit of a research trip for me).  If you could start thinking of suggestions for restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, etc. that would be great, and maybe if you're in town we could get together for a meal or a drink.\u000a\u000aThanks a bunch,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p828
aV\u000a\u000aNo LW's for me tonight either...have dinner plans with a friend and ditto tomorrow night.  Friday may a happy hour option though.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aThis is seriously stooping for me but my car's in the shop and I can't track down my roommate or anyone else that lives in close proximity to me... so, (now here's the stooping part) do you know what time your neighbor is heading home?\u000a
p829
aV\u000a\u000aPerfect....<NAME/> also just called to let me know that <NAME/> Conalee is playing at the Tin Hall tomorrow night, so that of course is another option.\u000a
p830
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks for resending the message.  I shouldn't have too much difficulty arranging travel, but I wanted to run a few things by you first.  It seems to me that it would be preferable to fly in Thursday evening, therefore freeing myself up to come in Friday at whatever time of day best suits yourself and the rest of the group.  If no one minds, it might even be nice to see some of the activity on the desk during cash trading.  Also, I anticipate staying through the weekend to see a bit more of the city and surrounding areas, but plan to cover those expenses myself.  If all of this is acceptable to you just let me know and I will begin making all of the necessary reservations.  I look forward to seeing you and meeting the rest of the group.\u000a\u000aIf you need to contact me for any reason, my mobile is the most reliable way to reach me...713-775-6472.\u000a\u000aThanks again,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a

p832
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI don't believe I received the form you referred to during our phone conversation.  If there is something you would like me to fill out, please feel free to forward it to this address.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p833
aV\u000a\u000aSure....I probably won't be able to come by until after lunch though.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p834
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly) and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will be able to stick to the new limit.\u000a\u000aThanks again,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWell, I think I managed to adequately disturb her yesterday.  Not only did I go to the Menil collection by myself (can you imagine?)...I also went to berryhill and ate dinner solo.  When I got back to the apartment she said I should've called and she would've met me for eats.  My immediate response, "Actually, I needed some solo time."  Subject closed.  As for the lease, brought up the subject and it went pretty much no where.  Discovered we could sign a year lease and if she decides to up and go I can move into a one bedroom if I give the complex 30 days notice...which is what I'm figuring we'll end up doing.  I also told her that I got my airplane ticket through council travel on British Airways leaving the 5th and returning the 12th (via email yesterday) and she didn't mention it last night.  Who knows?  I'm not going to mention it anymore, it's up to her.  And ditto on the witty repartee.\u000a
p837
aV\u000a\u000aI'm kind of between places right now, so it's probably best to just send things to my parents house\u000a\u000a10802 Jaycreek\u000a<NAME/>, TX 77070\u000a\u000aand I would suggest trying to reach me via my cell phone:  713-775-6472\u000a\u000ai guess i'll see you at the next tasters!!!\u000a
p838
aV\u000a\u000aI just checked some of the air fare sights and there are flights available for around what I paid for mine....not sure what i'm going to do regarding the roomie...really will have to tell her soon.  I'll be thinking.  Let me know if you come up with anything.\u000a
p839
aV\u000a\u000aI'm probably heading out of here in a few minutes, so call me on my cell phone.  <NAME/> said she was up for going tonight too!!!  I think she's going to come over to my apartment around 7 or so. \u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p840
aV\u000a\u000aI got this a while ago from my dad, but i found it so moving i thought i should share it with all of you.\u000a
p841
aV\u000a\u000aOkay,  I'm in for driving together on Friday.  Although I'd love to see my sister and her family in <NAME/>, I decided last night that I'm just too tuckered out to make this weekend any more exhausting than it's already going to be.  So...we just need to figure out what time we're leaving on Friday morning and who wants to drive.  I'm going to map out all of the directions for the weekend today so I cut down on my frustration level in regards to San <NAME/>.  Absolutely no more getting lost for <NAME/>...zapps my energy.\u000a\u000aTalk to you later,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p842
aV\u000a\u000aStill working on it...have to talk about the apartment and leases tonight.  Talk about bad news bears!\u000a
p843
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSorry to be a pest of late.  I was hoping you might have an opportunity to talk this morning.  There are some deadlines I am facing currently that make it that much more beneficial for me to talk to you sooner rather that later.  If you could let me know if there is a time before 10:00 PST that would be a good time to talk I would really appreciate it.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p844
aV\u000a\u000ayou're not slow at all....you just have to figure out which region they're in and ask the appropriate trader which gas daily volatility they'd like to use.\u000a\u000aCongrats on "the move"...O'<NAME/> told me the good news.\u000a
p845
aV\u000a\u000aYou'd probably better tell me what day works for you....you're the one with the family.  I'll give you a call as soon as I can find a phone down here.\u000a
p846
aV\u000a\u000aUGH....sorry i missed your call last night.  I can't find your phone number either...i'll give you a call if you email it to me. otherwise, just give me a call later today.\u000a
p847
aV\u000a\u000aI'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but I fear alas my liver would go on strike, and from what I understand the liver is a fairly vital organ...my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last Friday.\u000a\u000aDespite all of this I still look forward to engaging in engrossing AND coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBy the way, do we have a particular time in mind?\u000a
p848
aV\u000a\u000agood luck w/ the car shopping!!!  i'm anxious to hear what transpires...\u000a\u000aas for me, i was off last night and maybe if we have some time this weekend i can fill you in on what's happened to me over the course of this week.  but the bright spot in the whole thing is that dinner last night reminded me of the person i've been and how far i've come in the last 10 or so years of my life...and i think it gave me the extra shove, push or whatever you want to call it to really end the rotten situation i've been mired in.  i don't know that the dinner was to blame completely for my sudden "illness", b/c a large portion of it may have been psychological...i had an appointment for a final chat last night, and i think i was getting sick just thinking about doing what i had to do...but i did it, on my terms and there weren't any warm fuzzies or expressions of disappointment on my part and i rejected his suggestion of a shift to friendship....so there it is, now it just up to me to "stay sober" so to speak and kick the habit for good.\u000a\u000atalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p849
aV\u000a\u000aWas wondering if you'd like a ride home this evening.  Also, if <NAME/> would like one she's more than welcome to join.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIt's a very mixed web of information and people...it may take a while, but someone knows where all this information lies.  Ganapathy is a great information source.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aYou're gonna kill me, but I left all my T-account notes at home this morning.  Can you shoot me the FUGG breakdown again?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p852
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI went out to the web-site for the 20K to check my official time and I'm not listed anywhere.  I have a feeling something could have been confused with my number switch, etc.  Do you have any idea who I might contact to get that information?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p853
aV\u000a\u000aSo transparent....I will pay you good money to hook-up with this guy.  Would get hours of enjoyment from such an event.\u000a
p854
aV\u000a\u000aGreat....sounds good to me.  Can't wait to see you guys.\u000a
p855
aV\u000a\u000ayou would think...the 1st time you hear the comment....but those have been made now with careless abandon..everyday...regardless of whether i'm doing good, bad or even breathing\u000a
p856
aV\u000a\u000aThe email was titled "nothing bad..." so you wouldn't immediately trash it for fear I was dispensing some more of <NAME/>'s homespun wisdom.  I know you can't get enough of that stuff.  As for the revenue generation, I've heard what a boon the Ag group has been to EGM.  From what I understand you guys are carrying the rest of that company on your backs...keep up the good work!  And yes, the world you live in does revolve around you <NAME/>, it's just that no one else lives in that world besides you so it stands to reason that would be the case.  Your welcome for the email.  I really am happy for you that things seem to be going well and that you appear to be enjoying what you're doing (I haven't heard any of the "when I grow up I want to be a ....." comments out of you in a while, a sure sign of contentment and maturity - okay burgeoning maturity).  In regards to trading, I am absolutely loving it.  I've been on EOL for a little over a month now (although my trades go into one of the other trader's books for the time being...I should get my own in a couple months) and am really enjoying the new life/perks this job allows.  Case in point, took my Mom to see <NAME/>'s last game with the Rockets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am off to Vegas this weekend to "meet" with some of the power traders from Portland.  So much for the 16-18 hour days I was dealing with for a year or so there...given present circumstances it was all worth it.\u000a\u000aNo need to "let me of the hook" for my candor last night, I meant everything I said and I wanted you to hear those things.  In a quest to be an oh so witty smart-ass, sometimes I forget to just tell people what I think/feel...always catches up to me in hind-sight and if the opportunity presents itself for me to rectify that then I don't believe in passing it up.  Contrary to what you may think, I'm a big girl who thinks for herself and always acts on her own volition.  And I think I either mumbled last night or your hearing is starting to go in your old age, but I said "clod" not "god"...subtle but important difference.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a- You missed an impressive dancing display at <NAME/>'s last night...I think I may have frightened some people.\u000a
p857
aV\u000a\u000aThey don't mention <NAME/> in the 5th paragraph....trying to look on the bright side...:)\u000a
p858
aV\u000a\u000aOk...my capitalization skills in that last email were horrible...I was checking it before I realized the next click would actually send the message...my apologies.\u000a
p859
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aIn an effort to make sure that I am adequately prepared for my interview, I wanted to touch base with you and confirm that I possess all the necessary information and forms.  Last week I received the packet you had mailed containing the application form and company information.  Also, I have confirmed my flights, hotel arrangements and the directions to your facilities with <NAME/> Roberts.  I assume all the information needed prior to my arrival is already in my possession, if you know of any additional information I may need please let me know.  The last area of interest I am hoping to address is the actual interview schedule.  If it is possible at this point in time, I would appreciate the chance to preview the individuals with whom I will be meeting.  If the interviews have not been completely arranged as of yet then simply disregard the last request.  I look forward to meeting and speaking with you tomorrow.\u000a\u000aThank you,\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/>\u000a
p860
aV\u000a\u000aYou still interested in going to the Firehouse on tomorrow night?  I just checked my messages at home and <NAME/> called last night...at 9:45!  I was already passed out.  I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.  Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.  I talked to <NAME/> last night (before he'd called) and told her about the firehouse...she's definitely interested.  Let me know what you think.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p861
aV\u000a\u000aJesssseka!!!!\u000a\u000aI know, it's been ages since we've chatted.  I will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time.  \u000a\u000aI got <NAME/>'s message and thought I'd replied, but obviously I forgot.  I'm actually going out of town next weekend.  Which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again.  Of course, I suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with Jen and Caycie's weddings coming up.\u000a\u000aI talk to you soon,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aGlad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aJust wanted to make sure you're okay...woke up this morning and you hadn't come home.\u000a\u000aI may be heading out after morning trading to go home b/c I feel like dirt.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p865
aV\u000a\u000ajust tried to call you at the river house....if you're online, shoot me an email when you're about to get off\u000a
p866
aV\u000a\u000aOk kids...<NAME/> has made the excellent suggestion of Black Lab for food and drinks tomorrow.  So how does 6:00-6:30 sound to everyone?\u000a\u000aI think this link will take you to the appropriate map...if it doesn't work just go to Houstoncitysearch.com and look up Black Lab...it will take you to a map.\u000a\u000ahttp://houston.citysearch.com/map?mode=geo&lat=297360&lon=-953912&id=9842495&fid=2\u000a\u000aSee you then,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p867
aV\u000a\u000aThink I may head up to <NAME/> Sat-Sun but I'll be probably be here Sunday night and will definitely be here Monday....Did you know <NAME/> Olsen is playing at Blanco's tonight?  \u000a\u000aWhat are you doing this weekend?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p868
aV\u000a\u000aYou're gonna love this site.  So true.\u000a\u000a\u000ahttp://www.petnet.com.au/dogs/D162.html\u000a

aV\u000a\u000alooks like the curve was marked around 9.0625 for jun/sept...but you'll have to talk to keith holst to get an absolute price\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOurs is:\u000a\u000a3805 W. Alabama # 3308\u000a<NAME/>, TX 77027\u000a\u000aMy parents is:\u000a\u000a10802 Jaycreek\u000a<NAME/>, Tx 77070\u000a\u000aGlad I got to see you this weekend!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI won't give you Charlton Heston, but maybe <NAME/>y <NAME/>.\u000a
p872
aV\u000a\u000astill the wrong one...try sscott3@enron.com, that usually works for me.\u000a
p873
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'm so glad you emailed.  My parents were just asking me what you were up to this past Sunday...now I'll have something to report to them.  It's good to hear that things are going so well for you and I must say I'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer (I'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are).  \u000a\u000aWe will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town.  I may be going to <NAME/> for part of the long weekend, but I doubt I'll go before Saturday so Thursday and Friday are definite possibilities.  Happy to hear about your brother and <NAME/>'s impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of <NAME/> <NAME/>.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aWork  (713) 853-1455\u000aHome (713) 622-2788\u000aCell    (713) 775-6472\u000a\u000aPS- <NAME/>, you'll have to come out with us now....no more hiding.\u000a
p874
aV\u000a\u000aJust got the email myself...will definitely check it out.\u000a  \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p875
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>...good to hear from you.  <NAME/> all is well.  I assume you didn't get the other email I sent.  No biggie.  Just wrote to say Em and I tried to call NY's <NAME/>, but you had already checked out of your room.  I guess you were staying with Priyah (sp?) at that point.  \u000a\u000aTalk to you soon!!!!\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p876
aV\u000a\u000aFinally met Ashley Mace's man Saturday...ran into them at the cd store.  He's seems nice, but not at all what I would've expected and/or pictured.  It was strange to finally have a face to put with the image I'd conjured up.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p877
aV\u000a\u000aHi DeShonda,\u000a\u000aI had emailed a week or two ago in regards to the new parking and haven't heard anything back yet.  Could you drop me a line at your earliest convenience and let me know if it will be possible for me to obtain a space.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a<NAME/> M. <NAME/>\u000aX31455\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aParking & Transportation@ENRON\u000a03/28/2001 04:07 PM\u000a
p878
aV\u000a\u000aOkay, so I'd really like to make a trip up there this weekend ( I haven't spent a weekend in <NAME/> during April and can't imagine why I wouldn't just make the month a clean sweep).  Anyway, I know you're unbelievably busy right now and spending an entire weekend with me would not help you in the least...So, here's my suggestion:\u000a\u000aI could either come up Friday night and we could do a late dinner (say 8:30-9:00 ) and then find someplace to hang out for a while or just rent a movie.  On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to <NAME/> Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the <NAME/> Springs piece).\u000a\u000aThe other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.\u000a\u000aEither give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.  I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.\u000a
p879
aV\u000a\u000aHey...was wondering if you want to split this month's electricity bill...\u000a\u000aLast month was $175.00, this month is $183.00 and we've also started paying for water (which was only about $20 last month).  Anyway, just let me know...I won't make the full check out now if you want to split.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p880
aV\u000a\u000aI may cruise over to this place later with my work friend <NAME/>...would you have any interest in going?  Regardless, I'd still like to get together for dinner or a drink after work.  Drop me a line and let me know if you're still up for doing something. \u000a<NAME/>\u000a<NAME/> Electro's Guitar Bar \u000aThe bluesy music at this six-string bar has drawn celebrities and scenesters for years. \u000a\u000aBar/Club Profile	\u000aThe Scene\u000aThe bar's large courtyard, canopied entirely by trees, makes outdoor conversation pleasant even on <NAME/>'s sultry summer nights. \u000a\u000aThe Sound\u000aPatrons ("real nice folks") can settle in among the guitars with $2 draft beers and enjoy an eclectic sampling of music, from blues to alternative country, rock to folk. \u000a\u000aElectro-fying Blues\u000aThursday night's blues jam has been going on for more than 10 years and shows no signs of letting up, especially since it draws the likes of <NAME/> Allman and <NAME/> Gere. If you're really lucky, you might even catch <NAME/>, the owner, wailing away onstage on one of his own Danelectro guitars. \u000a<NAME/> Haupt\u000a
p881
aV\u000a\u000aFYI:  <NAME/> called last night to see if I wanted to go out again.  I think we'll probably end up going out on Thursday...I don't know.  We'll see how it goes, but I don't feel as excited or enthusiastic as I probably should.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p882
aV\u000a\u000aNext week sounds good to me too.  If everyone wants to meet at Ale house for a drink today why don't we try right after work.  <NAME/> had a very big night last night and needs to be in bed early tonight as a result.\u000a\u000aI can't wait to hear about the honeymoon either!!!!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI heard someone pulled a hamstring trying to be butch w/ the military workouts....\u000a\u000aAs for me, the trip was fantastic.  Mucho shopping and even more eating.  Not to mention the weather was beautiful and you could actually walk everywhere you wanted to go.  The plane flight back was definitely not fun, but I did survive.  It reminded me of London quite a bit, although I think the weather is milder.  I was actually checking out apartment sites the other day b/c I was that impressed with the place.  It has a definite <NAME/> vibe.  The people are extremely friendly, seem generally happy and there is lots of scenic beauty and tons of stuff to do.  Oh well,  I'll console myself with the fact that I get to live in H-town...always lifts my spirits.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p885
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>....FYI:  you already sent this email to everyone (at 10:48).\u000a
p886
aV\u000a\u000aCongrats on the promotion.  I was a little suprised it was only to manager...I remember you saying something once about jumping straight to Director.  All things in due time, right?\u000a
p887
aV\u000a\u000aOkay...I'm an idiot...I forgot to bring your email address with me to London (it's saved in my contacts list at work) and I can't check my work email from outside locations...augh!  Yet again, I fail.  However, I had such a good time visiting I think I'm going to try to make a quick trip back over this fall when the air fares are a little cheaper.  That way, I could see you and <NAME/> and <NAME/>.  I will stick your phone number in my physical address book and be a better visitor next go-round.\u000a\u000aSorry again for the oversight.  Also, the next trip I make will most likely be solo (my roommate in <NAME/> came with me this time) so it will be significantly easier for me to maneuver.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aAny luck on the roommate front?  Do you still want me to talk to <NAME/>?\u000a
p888
aV\u000a\u000aalso...just b/c india may be out doesn't mean the possibility of leaving ceases to exists...remember that\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aJust called...they're going to put it on our door tonight.  We just have to sign it and stick it in the night drop.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMatty already left work, but I'll be sure to pass the message along.\u000a
p892
aV\u000a\u000ahe's going to Vegas I think...And I have no idea when we'd go over there.  I'll talk to <NAME/> and see what she thinks.\u000a
p893
aV\u000a\u000aI believe this was intended for the other <NAME/> <NAME/>.  I'm <NAME/> M. <NAME/> and work in natural gas trading.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p894
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> wanted me to let you know that she's having a little soiree Friday evening around 7 pm...Very casual, but feel free to bring others.\u000a\u000aHopefully we'll see you there,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000ai can't the weekend of the 10th b/c of a 25K...but maybe the 3rd\u000a

aV\u000a\u000athis quote just fell out of one of my spirals....\u000a\u000a"The timid and fearful first failures dismay, but the stout heart stays trying by night and by day.

aV\u000a\u000aHey friend,\u000a\u000aI just got your card yesterday in the mail and am so thrilled that you've asked me to be a part of your wedding.  I will try and give you a call later on today or tonight to talk in person, but I wanted to let you know ASAP that I will gladly participate in any way possible in the pre-wedding and wedding day activities.  This really is such an exciting time in your life and I look forward to all of the festivities.\u000a\u000aLove,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS - Trish <NAME/> is playing tomorrow night at the Mucky Duck if you have any interest.\u000a
p898
aV\u000a\u000aI've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.  We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.  Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back <NAME/> Party"?  If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.  <NAME/> the paper(s) is/are going well.\u000a\u000aTalk to you soon,\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aPS - I'm in Seattle this weekend, so I'll miss the friend.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aTOBIN!!!!!......i was deceased, but i have arisen from the ashes....HOW ARE YOU?\u000a\u000aI want to hear all about the UK and how you are fairing there.  If i can manage, it I'd love to make a trip over there and see your pad, etc.  Sorry you never managed to meet up with emily, but she was actually in the US when you emailed and then only back in London for about a week to pack up and head home.  So you need to give me a kind of schedule for where you're going to be and when...(i.e. UK vs. US for holidays and what not).\u000a\u000aIf you have a Messenger account let me know...i'd love to chat "real-time" with you.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBTW:  I'll be in Portland mid-November for work...if you happen to be home then, I'd love to see you...otherwise, any suggestions would be much welcomed.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000athat could work...they do have food and it's not horribly crowded on Thursdays.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPlease tell me you're safe and well in San <NAME/>....I just got to thinking of you and the possibility that you'd be flying between DC and LA.\u000a

V\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aBases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discussions being held regarding the <NAME/> Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value of the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to take their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having struggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number of shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of <NAME/> employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforded a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not have ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fairly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The solution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation under the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!\u000a

Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its something I need to do.

aV\u000a\u000aI know you are frustrated with the adherence to the VAR limits or lack there of, so I do not want to frustrate you more, but I would like you to consider the following suggestions.\u000a	1)  It does not seem logical that the VAR limit between the Central, East and Texas Desk be so far apart.  Under the current limits the Central desk can have 			a position 2,000 Contracts larger than Texas and the East Desk 1,000 Contracts larger. \u000a	2)  When looking at performance YTD I wonder if higher VAR limits only gives the desks a greater ability to double down to try and make up the YTD losses.\u000a			VAR LIMITS		DESK P/L\u000a	   EAST	 	$10 MILLION		($66.1) MILLION\u000a	   CENTRAL	$12 MILLION		($13.9) MILLION\u000a	   TEXAS	$8  MILLION		$55.8   MILLION\u000a	3)  It also bothers me that everyone else does not hold the VAR limits in as high regard as <NAME/> & I.  There are no consequences if the VAR limit is violated.  In fact 		in days like today you are rewarded for breaking the VAR limit. I feel that the following should be implemented in order to stress the importance of the VAR 		limit.\u000a			The P/L for any desk exceeding the VAR Limit by more than $500,000 will be decreased each day by the amount they exceeded the VAR limit.\u000a			(For example if a desks VAR limit is 10,000,000 and the VAR is $12,000,000 the P/L for the desk would be decreased by $2,000,000.  If the 				situation is not corrected by the next day the same procedure would be followed.)\u000a		This method I believe makes for an even playing field.  Under the current procedures what I'm learning is if you ignore the VAR limits and you are right no 		one will remember at year end and you are rewarded for breaking the rules.  \u000a\u000aPlease give me your thoughts when you have a chance.\u000a\u000a	Thanks,  <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>:\u000a\u000aAssuming you can get comfortable with a percentage MMBtu enhancement from someone like <NAME/> <NAME/> (the only one I would trust) I would suggest a method that would reflect more than the spread.  The way I look at this is that the liquids that are picked up in the gas stream as you withdraw from storage is an unaccounted for gain.  As such, if the MMBtu enhancement percentage was 1% I would use a withdrawal volume of 101% of the injection volume.  We have to realize that in order to recognize this in the real world, the Accounting Group would have to implement Accounting procedures that would try to capture this value also.  Because under normal Accounting procedures for storage, barring completely emptying the facility of gas before refilling, this gain would merely remain in the ground with the remaining inventory.  Accounting would have to recognize the difference between the MMBtu factor on the gas withdrawn and the average MMBtu factor of the gas injected as a gain.  We still need to live within the physical capacity constraints This method more appropriately represents what you are gaining but increases your risk if the MMBtu enhancement percentage you use is too high!  I would appreciate being kept informed of what MMBtu enhancement percentage is used and how it is put in the model.\u000a\u000a	<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe currency P&L is missing from the preliminary again.  We shouldn't post P&L to the executive management reports with missing components.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aKarim , this is the deal that I was talking about this morning.  <NAME/> is saying that it should have appeared in Friday's P&L.  Can you check this with him and let my know today.  When you said it was in tonights P&L, I think <NAME/> was talking about the Telus deal not the Cisson deal.\u000a
p1001
aV\u000a\u000aDad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since:\u000a\u000aa) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential\u000acreditor action against <NAME/>.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.\u000a\u000ab) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that <NAME/> is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be \u000adone until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the \u000aUS since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new <NAME/> deal) are there.\u000a\u000ac) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at\u000a4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.\u000a\u000ad) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this\u000acategory, but not like a mortgage.\u000a\u000a\u000aHopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGiven the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on <NAME/> Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Zufferli\u000a
p1009
aV\u000a\u000aWe have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.\u000a\u000aWe have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.\u000a\u000aIt is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.\u000a\u000aThe timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by <NAME/>.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.\u000a\u000aIn that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that\u000atanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to \u000a11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.\u000a\u000aI am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.  \u000a\u000aThe trade for a 25 MW long <NAME/> flat position would be:\u000a			a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak\u000a			b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak <NAME/> portion of the the gas hedge)\u000a			c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis\u000a\u000aSee what you think??\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am reading your mail, I have asked for the same thing regarding my base. Especially since I came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 CDN/USD and with no raise since being here at 1.61 CDN/USD I have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in <NAME/>.

aV\u000a\u000aI talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey Guys,\u000a\u000a\u000aI do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?\u000a\u000aWhile the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an <NAME/> representative.\u000a\u000aLet me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.\u000a\u000aThank you for your cooperation.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi, \u000a\u000aI need to look at the calendar again, but I think we will be leaving on Saturday the 9th of June.  We'll probably stop in Coffeyville for a day or so and come on through to Omaha.  \u000a\u000aI'm sad to hear that Daddy's tube does not seem to be doing the job.  I had to hear that, because I too feel confident that if we can get some nourishment into his body that he will get alot better.  I'm so glad you stepped in and are taking matters into your own hands.  I also feel like Daddy feels real good that you are stepping in as well.  I spoke with Mom yesterday, daddy was sleep, so she really got a chance to tell me how everything really is.  She too is now saying that Daddy is in pretty bad shape.\u000a\u000aI asked Daddy about the retirement, and he said the same thing,  he is not ready yet. but the reality of it is, is that we still need to move now and not wait.  I just hope he understands.  I'm glad Daddy is not in alot of pain.  I think with him seeing the boys will really cheer him up.  It's so hard to face all of this uncertainty isn't it.  The good part, if there is any, is that Daddy is going to a better place with no more suffering.  He's certainly had a good life and we all want him to go on forever, but if there is pain involved, I 'd rather see him out of pain.  Just keep praying for Daddy as well as Mom.  \u000a\u000aIf there is anything I can do from hear, just let me know.\u000a\u000aTalk with you later!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey girl,\u000a\u000aWhat's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really could have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and they had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at 6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating at 6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl, Ms Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top that I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I wore my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high heel sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.  When I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said "Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take some pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile). \u000a\u000aWe have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, <NAME/> said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!\u000a\u000aLooking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I was wondering where <NAME/> had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that she's back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.\u000a\u000aHow did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll get a chance to visit tonight.  <NAME/> already said he wasn't going to be home until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change too.  Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.  All we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different, independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break and new environment.\u000a\u000aOh well, talk with you later!\u000a\u000aThanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHi Gene,\u000a\u000aAs promised, here are estimated historical pricing for deliveries at the Nipsco city gate.  These prices are by no means, what we specifically charged at the time, but should give you an idea if this pricing is more competitive than the prices you have received in the past.  These prices also assume that you purchased gas at the First of the Month Index.  Please keep in mind that these sales prices are for deliveries to the Nipsco City gate, and you will need to find out what Nipsco will charge you to transport the gas from the city gate to your burner tip.  If my memory serves me, I believe you indicated that you were buying your gas directly from Nipsco, and if that is the case, then we will be comparing "apples to apples".\u000a\u000aJanuary, 2001			$10.99\u000a\u000aFebruary, 2001			$  6.61\u000a\u000aMar, 2001			$  5.38\u000a\u000aApr. 2001			$  5.70\u000a\u000aMay, 2001			$  5.13\u000a\u000aJune, 2001			$  3.95\u000a\u000aJuly, 2001			$  3.40\u000a\u000aAugust, 2001			$  3.25\u000a\u000aSeptember, 2001		$  2.42\u000a\u000aOctober, 2001			$  2.00\u000a\u000a\u000aI still need to find out from you what type of volume you will need on a daily basis.

Please write back and tell me his full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!\u000a

p1097
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI haven't heard or seen anything yet on the executed contract?  Is everything okay?  I'll be out of the office traveling next week, and I wanted to get a status before I left.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1098
aV\u000a\u000aWhat's happening down in your area?  It's very scary.  You just don't know what's going to happen!  It's a crying shame what's happening to <NAME/>.  Who would have ever thought this?\u000a
p1099
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHere is the telephone number to the place that <NAME/> Logsdon works.  The guy listed at the bottom works for <NAME/>.\u000a
p1100
aV\u000a\u000aI turned in the tickedt last night...but they came around with questions this a.m.....so being booked today.\u000a\u000aNicor's AGA is 53\u000a
p1101
aV\u000a\u000aYes, my sister, you have been heavy on my mind.....is everything okay with you?  How are the proceedings coming along?\u000a\u000aEverything on my end is okay...still alot of unanswered questions and i'm just waiting to get answers.  The positive is that we do have a buyer for the trading group....because it could of easily have been the situation, whereby, nobody was interested.  Thank God that did not happen.\u000a\u000aI've got to plan a birthday party for Jordan next week, and as usual, i'm wracking my brain trying to decide what to do,  I detest parties on Saturday at these public place because of the large crowds.  Got any ideas?\u000a\u000aBy the way, has <NAME/> learned how to read yet?  Jordan tells me he really wants to learn how to read, and I want to make sure that my baby is not behind the rest of the pack.  I went to the library yesterday and checked out about 7 books for my baby.  We are some reading fools these days.\u000a\u000aWrite back!!!!\u000a
p1102
aV\u000a\u000aHey girl,\u000a\u000aSorry, I received all of your messages, but did not respond, sorry.  So little C.J. looks like a "half-breed", (that's what you''re trying to say!).  Is he cute?  I can't wait to see him.  Yes, I did talk to <NAME/> yesterday afternoon, she sounded happy.  \u000a\u000aI spoke with Daddy yesterday and told him to sit his butt down and stop trying to go to work, especially if there are no health benefits that he will be losing.  Instead of concentrating on that job, I told him to concentrate on his health.  He said I was right, and said he was going to seriously consider it.  I had to laugh when he said he went to work and fell asleep reading or trying to throw away some paperwork.  That was hilarious.  Can you imagine the secretary going in and finding "little bitty" daddy sitting there asleep.  I cracked up.\u000a\u000aThe concert was good, you know those young men "showed out".  However, the concert was supposed to start at 8 and did not start til 9 and had several acts before them and as a result, did not get out of the concert until 1:15 p.m.   I was a tired sister, but it was well worth it.  The <NAME/> Southwest is close to me, its right be Sharpstown Mall.  Tell me that dates again.  \u000a\u000aTalk with you later.\u000a
p1103
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aThanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding Alliance and/or Vector pipeline.  This information is extremely important as we are trading this product on EnronOnline without much information.  Also could you please add <NAME/> <NAME/> and <NAME/> Schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the Alliance and Vector gas.  One last request, could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily AOS allocations.\u000a\u000aThanks again.\u000a
p1104

You forgot to answer my question regarding what financial entity you would be trading under,  is it Corn Products International?  Write back, because I need this information for the contracts, etc.\u000a

p1106
aV\u000a\u000aSo sorry about that.....We do not have a date for you b/c the  contract does not exist as of yet.  Legal said that we could just end that sentence right after the word "transactions".  take out the language that says "including without limitation the Enfolio.......\u000a\u000a\u000aOnce you make that deletion, how long do you think it will take to have it executed and a copy faxed to me at 713-646-3390?\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks, we're almost there!!!!!!\u000a
p1107
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aHow are you?  Thank you so much for your concern regarding my son.  He broke his elbow on Sunday afternoon while playing on the monkey bars.  It was quite scary, but his spirits are high again and he seems to be making the adjustment.  \u000a\u000aIt means alot to me to get messages from you regarding my family's well-being.\u000a\u000aThanks again for your genuine concern!!!!  You're the best!\u000a
p1108
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a\u000aHere are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.  Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.\u000a\u000aI'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).\u000a\u000aYear 2003			$.3.355\u000a\u000aYear 2004			$3.45\u000a\u000aYear 2005			$3.54\u000a\u000aYear 2006			$3.62\u000a\u000aYear 2007			$3.71\u000a\u000aYear 2008			$3.81\u000a\u000aAs far as a publication such as PIRA, that <NAME/> would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.\u000a\u000aRegarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.\u000a\u000aP.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.\u000a\u000aPlease reply when you have a moment.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

p1111
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a\u000aI have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m.  My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the  5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".  He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.  I'll keep pushing!  \u000a\u000aPlease let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1112
aV\u000a\u000aThat's fine, but I think I got off kinda cheap, so let me know if I need to contribute more!  It was so much fun!\u000a
p1113
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and <NAME/> Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1114
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>,\u000a\u000a\u000aAttached, please find <NAME/>'s offer for Trunkline East Louisiana volumes for the winter months ending in 2002 and 2003.\u000a\u000aPlease feel free to call me at 713-853-5772 should you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThank you\u000a
p1115
aV\u000a\u000aI beleive this is the final.  please have someone approve and execute, so I can set out.  Sorry, I sat on it for awhile and now its a rush.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1116
aV\u000a\u000aPlease prepare a wire transfer to Crestar in the amount of $873,572 for the above referenced time period. This wire transfer should be made effective June 1, 2001.\u000a\u000aThank you for your help!\u000a
p1117
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI understand that you were out of the office on Friday, and I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I will call you on Monday mid-morning.  The customer has called again on Friday, and I would like to get this thing resolved.  Please work with me on this issue.  I'm not sure what Enerson's role is anymore, but we need "all hands on deck" to get this issue ironed out immediately.\u000a\u000aMy cell # is 713-851-6240 and you may call me anytime.  I'll be visiting customers, but please call and leave a message if I'm not available.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1118
aV\u000a\u000aYes, I thought we had sent you the contract already.  The actual contract only refers to a delivery point at the Chicago city gates, and not specifically Peoples or Nicor, if I'm not mistaken.  Is this going to be a problem?  I'm sorry, I thought it had been forwarded to you already!!!!\u000a
p1119
aV\u000a\u000aI called you back at 10:31, i'll try again in about 15/20 minutes.  You should carry your cell phone in your purse in case you need to call me.  Then you van hang up and I'll call you right back!\u000a

Thanks\u000a
p1122
aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI've done some research on the actuals that you make reference to (Vectren).\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s sale with Heartland Steel is at the interconnect between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Vectren (formerly know as Indiana Gas).  The actual volumes that you are reporting and consider to be your monthly actuals are volumes that I believe are behind Vectren's city gate (which means that you more than likely have an imbalance on Vectren's system).  This bears checking with Vectren, regarding an imbalance behind their gate.  You should be receiving some type of statement or invoice from Vectren.\u000a\u000aPer the contract, <NAME/> uses the Midwestern Gas Transmission (pipeline statement) to actualize our monthly invoices to you.\u000a\u000aI've attempted to draw a diagram for you to make it as clear as I can.\u000a\u000aLet's talk!\u000a\u000a_________________________________________XXXX_______________________________________________________________________________XXX \u000aMidwestern Gas Pipeline                            Interconnect b/t Vectren                 (this pipe owned by Vectren)                                       Heartland Steel Facility\u000a	                                                    & Midwestern Gas Pipeline	                                                                                           (Burner Tip)\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000\u000a           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically\u000a           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (<NAME/> Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point\u000a           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  <NAME/> was involved in this point.\u000a56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.\u000a1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to <NAME/> Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.

aV\u000a\u000aWhen doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. \u000aWe allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have\u000anot previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.\u000a.\u000aExample :  Allocations are as follows\u000a\u000aThe only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue\u000aTimely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)\u000a                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)\u000a                   Laplata/<NAME/>                                  500.000  (capacity)\u000a                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)\u000aEvening:      Same sequence \u000aNon-Grid:     Same sequence\u000a\u000aID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  \u000a                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse \u000a                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should \u000a                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously\u000a                   allocated.                   \u000a             \u000a The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.\u000alets try this for a while and see how it is working.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run\u000athe pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams\u000apossibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they\u000awere well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream\u000athat is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.\u000aWe in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.\u000aIf I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.

aV\u000a\u000aHey Nella,\u000a\u000aWhen I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".\u000a\u000aHe just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.\u000a\u000aHow was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, <NAME/> and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.\u000a\u000aThis morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of <NAME/>'s good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.\u000a\u000a\u000aTalk with you later\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThat's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey publlishes had a coupon for August <NAME/> stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about <NAME/>, it was such a late night.

I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your <NAME/> songs and I will be in Omaha for <NAME/> so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on <NAME/> anyway.  Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on <NAME/> for all 4 services.\u000a\u000aThis daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.\u000a\u000aDid you find any houses that you liked?

I really meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  \u000a\u000aBy the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that <NAME/> and Anessa Hall <NAME/> are supposed to be pregnant!  \u000a\u000aSee you!\u000a

To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that <NAME/> 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!\u000a\u000aHow was your gay cruise?

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aAttached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and <NAME/> Cogans. the main issue is as follows:\u000a\u000a1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.\u000a\u000aI hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.

aV\u000a\u000aHello again,\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> <NAME/> yesterday and exchanged emails with <NAME/> - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If <NAME/> didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  \u000a\u000aI do wish you would come down here with <NAME/> sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  <NAME/> could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!\u000a\u000aYes - I am still hanging out with <NAME/>.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun! \u000a\u000aKeep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!\u000a\u000aLove, <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000amy friend Shannon is coming over at about 6:30 and we are going out - somewhere.  what are you doing?\u000a
p1307
aV\u000a\u000aJ.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> wants to know if any of the lawyers have seen the documents provided by CDWR.  Let me know  what their take is.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1308
aV\u000a\u000aI did know all of that - talked to her just the other day.  I will miss her too!  Let me know if, when you need anything.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1309
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1310
aV\u000a\u000aI sent the spreadsheet and instructions to <NAME/> Parker.  She should be putting it together for you.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aps.  I will be out until Jan. 14 except for checking in on the 28th and the 2nd.\u000a
p1311
aV\u000a\u000aJust talked to Noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared.  They want to do a 20 year, fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price.  All other gas outside the 10% swing will be priced at Gas Daily +/- $.05.  We are adding a $.25 premium on the 10% swing and the baseload is approximately 1000/day.  If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal, they would like to see what those are - that might sway them.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal.  And they have asked me for this credit information twice today.  It's all about you!!\u000a\u000aThanks a million for your help!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aWhile on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.\u000a\u000aI know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.

Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.  \u000awhat do you think?

aV\u000a\u000aI was working out at 5:30 this a.m.!  What's the matter with you?  Were you able to get the trailer off of your truck?  When I got home, <NAME/> came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.  Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met <NAME/> at the park for a jog.  Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City. \u000a\u000aLonely, huh?  When does <NAME/> move in?\u000a\u000aK.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> & Stacy,\u000a\u000aI didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.

Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  <NAME/>'t know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?

How was Tennessee and your Thanksgiving?  Mine was just so, so.  Worrying about work and my friends (and self) getting laid off.  I do hope all is well with you - call me sometime this week -\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p1373
aV\u000a\u000aI am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa <NAME/>, also known as Silicon Valley Power.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI agree with <NAME/>.  I wasn't here until January so I was not aware of the Dec. 28 deal.  I think that when we do August, my information should be complete.  Sorry for all of the inconveniences.  Thanks for your help.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000ap.s.  I will tell <NAME/>.\u000a
p1377
aV\u000a\u000aWow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think that there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that part.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very nice.  Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as for <NAME/> - she was with EES on a product development project.  She worked with Corporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been asked to stay on with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.  At least this way, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so sure about the EES gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to come here for Thanksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they shouldn't make the trip - so they aren't coming.  <NAME/>'t know for sure what I will do but I refuse to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am sick of hanging out with myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer and perhaps tropical?  I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a beer after - its the holiday season and time for (good) cheer!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.\u000a\u000aLet me know if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAs I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?\u000a\u000aLet me know how things look for you as soon as possible.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOnce again, I didn't have all information and shared with you an incomplete package for july!  Attached is a spreadsheet with the missing peices.

p1482
aV\u000a\u000aThanks <NAME/>, we have left a message for <NAME/> and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.\u000a\u000aThanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I apologize.  Your right.  The imbalances are short to the pipe.  To be sure we are all\u000a	on the same page.  All the deliveries off of NNG on this report took more gas than scheduled and the\u000a	receipts gave us less than scheduled.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1490
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, no problem we can call you in for your part only.  I do not have any more detail\u000a	at this time, but if we get some before the 29th I will pass it on to you.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

p1495
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I appreicate your feedback and closure on these items.  It helps us to build\u000a	that confidence that the systems are working correctly instead of being left in\u000a	"limbo" and coming up with your own conclusions.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1496
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I had to change from <NAME/> to <NAME/> on your reviewers.  I will still visit with\u000a	<NAME/> since you did put her name down.\u000a\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1497
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, FYI.  I had <NAME/> pull this info together for me when we were justifying moving\u000areservation billing by one day.  This will need to be talked about for July billing of\u000aJune production.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

p1500
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, following are the questions you asked and my answers.  Please give me a call if you have\u000a	any questions. (713-853-7637).  \u000a\u000a	1.  Number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?\u000a\u000a		Answer:  Yes\u000a\u000a	2.   Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?\u000a\u000a		Answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation.  \u000a			  When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals)\u000a	 		  at the storage point.  The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same\u000a			  cycle.\u000a\u000a	3.  If we were nominating our Firm from <NAME/> to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from?\u000a\u000a		Answer:  Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred\u000a\u000a	4.  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc or Demarc Deferred?\u000a\u000a		Answer:  Demarc Deferred\u000a\u000a	Hopefully this helped.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

It looks like we will be in the same\u000a	mode of operation at least through this morning.  \u000a\u000a	Please make every effort to contact your customers and let them know they\u000a	can get into Hottap through URL:\u000a		\u000a			www.hottap.enroncorp.com\u000a	 	\u000a	If they are having problems accessing Hottap, give them the pertinent information they\u000a	need to do their "next cycle" business (ie. schedule quantity info).  Let's be proactive and \u000a	help the customers through this frustrating time.\u000a\u000a	I also appreicate everyone staying around until 6:00 last night.  It is good to work with \u000a	a group that is willing to help out where possible.\u000a\u000a	Also, Toby thanks for your "hours" of work on sending out the emails to our customers\u000a	to let them know what our plans were. \u000a\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIs the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry\u000a	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking\u000a	with <NAME/> Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of\u000a	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can \u000a	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  \u000a\u000a	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical\u000a	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone\u000a	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1512
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, did you get my message about possibly going to LA?  Looks like I am going\u000a	unless cost is ridiculous.

Please review and let <NAME/> or I know if you need any clarification.\u000a\u000a	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?\u000a\u000a		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount\u000a			  (2) RANK changed to a different number\u000a\u000a	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?\u000a\u000a		Answer - Tariff Sheet 267.D & E (Raetta, so you agree?)\u000a\u000a	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?\u000a\u000a		Answer - <NAME/> (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group\u000a\u000a	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can <NAME/> Power\u000a	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?\u000a\u000a		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation\u000a			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from\u000a		              the field to the market area.

aV\u000a\u000aI talked to <NAME/> with ENW and told her I would pass her concern on to\u000a	the regulatory and marketing group.  That seem to make her feel better\u000a	anyway.

aV\u000a\u000aWe finally found the right person in the KN Energy organization for the 18 dth <NAME/> Obligation.\u000a\u000a	KN will nominate today for Gas Day 26th going forward.

We left messages at \u000a	3 different offices.  KN admitted to seeing the posting but "did not understand" the obligation\u000a	and they did not call for clarification.\u000a\u000a	If you have any questions, please let <NAME/> (Ext. 7429) or I (Ext. 7637) know.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, here is the correct spelling of the two names we talked about today in the team leader\u000ameeting.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1609
aV\u000a\u000aJust to clarify Britt's comments.  <NAME/> is using NNG's numbers for total imbalance.  To split the\u000a	imbalance among the third party shippers, we will continue to use Oneok's allocation of actual\u000a	volumes.  The variance between Oneok and NNG will go to the Oneok imbalance to tie to NNG's\u000a	ultra sonic measurement.   Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1610
aV\u000a\u000aLet's discuss again on Monday if we need to relook at hard coding the allocation\u000a	based on discussions with <NAME/> and <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1611

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>, please let me know if we are not going to have this\u000ainfo by Tuesday.  THanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1618
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/> and <NAME/>, we reviewed the attached recommendation and wanted to pass on\u000a	an idea to you. On NNG, we are trying to ensure new or existing meters do NOT come on without\u000a	a schedule volume to ensure proper billing.  Since TBS' on NNG do not always have a scheduled \u000a	volume tied to it, we may need to ensure the volume is covered at the Zone level by the shipper.  \u000a	Do you think this is something the Measurement Desk could help the field with?  We certainly\u000a	would be glad to help in any way on the scheduling side. This is especially important for new meters\u000a	as we go through the billing process.  \u000a	Just a thought.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1619
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, just wanted to be sure you saw this.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

The hospital\u000a(Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the\u000aMedthodist and <NAME/> hospitals.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/> all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have\u000amore damage than you did.

She felt very good about the process\u000a	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.\u000a\u000a	We can discuss when I get back next week.  \u000a\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

The above referenced\u000afields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this\u000agroup has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not\u000agiving up on possibilities.\u000a\u000aAs you are aware, <NAME/> and <NAME/> have already started using the report\u000aand we have changed how we report outages and allocations.

In talking with <NAME/>, I think you are all booked up for the\u000a	Sunday activity, but <NAME/> put <NAME/> on the list in case of a cancellation.  \u000a\u000a	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the "mis matches" across interconnecting\u000a	pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for the <NAME/> pipes and I wold like to know\u000a	if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these mismatches.  If you would like\u000a	to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.  \u000a\u000a	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

There were a few isolated situations which were turned\u000a	around quickly.  \u000a\u000a	Otherwise it was quiet on the pipes.  \u000a	\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

p1680
aV\u000a\u000aFYI.  Wanted to pass on this information.  After working with Minnegasco to help them\u000a	use Park and Ride as much as possible (considering we were allocating storage), the\u000a	Minnegasco scheduler went into the system for Friday's gas day and changed their business\u000a	between Intraday 1 and Intraday 2.  This caused cuts through Demarc and Mid 17.  We \u000a	tried to help as much as possible and keep the same rules we have with all other shippers.\u000a	If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1681
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I am sorry I did not get this sent to you earlier, but I have a prior commitment and will not\u000abe able to attend.  I hope it is a good time for everyone else.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

If that is not correct let me\u000a	know and we can give one of you the 12th and the other a later game.\u000a\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1683
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, would you please print this presentation in color for me.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1684

p1685
aV\u000a\u000aAn update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions\u000ahave come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the\u000aquestions.  I have left <NAME/> Bodnar and <NAME/> Buchanan a phone mail message\u000ato research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with\u000astorage and determine what changes need to be made.\u000a\u000aOne change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to\u000abe able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are\u000aallocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating\u000awithdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  <NAME/> Bodnar will\u000apursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1686
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/> is in Arkansas.  She is doing a lot better.  Her "tingling\u000ain her arm and leg acted up again.  Hopefully she will be home\u000athis weekend.  I'll let you know when we hear something for sure.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI just reviewed a vacation report that covers vacation up through 8/15/01.\u000a\u000a	There are still a lot of people with a large amount of vacation.  I made an assumption\u000a	everyone is carrying over 40 hours (which is the max) to 2002.  There was still a lot\u000a	of vacation to be taken.\u000a\u000a	I would like to meet with a member from each team Friday, September 14, at 2:00\u000a	to review your teams schedule for the rest of the year.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, when you have time let's discuss.  Overall I am OK with plan, but had a question about who\u000a	was monitoring imbalances.  Sounds like Marketing is instead of Gas Logistics?  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, thank you for the update.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, it was good to visit with you yesterday.  Here are the questions and answers that we promised you \u000a	at the conference call on Tuesday, November 6.  Please review and let <NAME/> or I know if you need any clarification.\u000a\u000a	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?\u000a\u000a		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount\u000a			  (2) RANK changed to a different number\u000a\u000a	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?\u000a\u000a		Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E \u000a\u000a	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?\u000a\u000a		Answer - <NAME/> (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group\u000a\u000a	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can <NAME/> Power\u000a	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?\u000a\u000a		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation\u000a			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from\u000a		              the field to the market area. (<NAME/> we may not have been clear on this comment\u000a			  on the conference call)\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, Teb is right..  Beginning with June billing for May production, we are billing FTS-2 reservation invoices on\u000aJune 1 instead of May 31.  At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.  This would be \u000aafter we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectively\u000acapture the scheduled volumes for the last day of the month.  <NAME/> I have not confused the issue for you.  \u000aIf you have any other questions, please let me know\u000aThanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:\u000a\u000a	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?\u000a\u000a	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement\u000a	     list.  I like the idea of automating the last bullet.  I am not sure if it is in CMS or elsewhere, but\u000a	     I would like to be sure we pursue this automation.\u000a	Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a
p1757

p1759
aV\u000a\u000aI would like to recap my understanding and the "To Do's" from the meeting yesterday.  \u000a\u000a		1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical\u000a	                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.\u000a\u000a		2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were\u000a	                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that\u000a	 	     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).\u000a\u000a		3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for\u000a		     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be\u000a		     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).\u000a\u000a		4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by\u000a		     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the \u000a		     TBS connected to NNG.\u000a\u000a		5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including\u000a		     End User point volumes would be "housed' in PGAS.\u000a\u000a	After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a\u000a	negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:\u000a\u000a		1.  Measurement should either:\u000a\u000a			a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end\u000a			     user point higher than their TBS.\u000a\u000a			b.  Or Measurement can call <NAME/> <NAME/> on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk\u000a			     and <NAME/> will call LDC with the same info.\u000a\u000a		2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will\u000a		     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.\u000a\u000a	<NAME/> and <NAME/>, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want.\u000a	I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and <NAME/> are\u000a	 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be\u000a	greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.\u000a\u000a	If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, thanks for the keys.  I appreciate you staying on top of this.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

p1780
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I wanted to follow up after discussions with you and <NAME/>, the SoCal window is based on what SoCal\u000a    is willing to confirm into their system for the day.  It does not necessarily have anything to do with physical capacity at Needles.\u000a    If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks.  <NAME/>\u000a

p1784
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I talked with <NAME/> Miller and he confirmed that the Storage group sends \u000a	storage volumes to EIA for reporting purposes.  They do NOT send anything to\u000a	AGA.  But it is his understanding that AGA is getting their information from EIA\u000a	so by default he believes that AGA gets NNG's storage numbers.  As a reminder\u000a	this question came up in the staff meeting this week and I was to follow up with <NAME/>.\u000a\u000a	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> and <NAME/>, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morning in the meeting.  High level\u000a	recap is:\u000a\u000a\u000a		130,000		Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day\u000a		 95,000		Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to\u000a					repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from\u000a					the previous day)\u000a\u000a		140,000		Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance\u000a					plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF.  In looking at LSF, we\u000a					were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked\u000a					to be pretty evenly distributed)\u000a\u000a		 15,000		Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.\u000a		_______\u000a		380,000		The total swing was 419,000.  The difference of 39,000 is a combination\u000a					operational adjustments.\u000a\u000a	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.  If you have any questions, please let me\u000a	know.

aV\u000a\u000aShould we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?  I had a question from Alliant,\u000a	"You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation,\u000a	why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR?  Wouldn't that help the system?"  I think it would be\u000a	hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all\u000a	at the same time.  What do you guys think?  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

p1853
aV\u000a\u000aI am concerned we will have/or should have some of the frank discussions we have\u000a	with AA setting in the room.

I can\u000a	live with either decision, but I want to prep my people before the meeting if AA\u000a	attends.  Thanks. <NAME/>\u000a

A Confirmation may be sent by Company to Customer confirming the Flexible Pricing agreement in accordance with Exhibit "A" "Fixed Price" means a fixed dollar amount agreed to by the Parties.  The price for all Gas for which a Flexible Price has not been agreed by the Parties shall be the original Contract Price applicable to the Transaction.  "Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Confirmation or the GTC, upon Customer's acceptance of Fixed Price, Customer shall keep whole and hold Company harmless for all cost and expenses incurred by Company with respect to the quantity of Gas that is converted into a Fixed Price, in the event that such quantity of Gas is not Scheduled by Customer for any reasons, including without limitation events of Force Majeure.\u000a\u000aFor the Section "Daily Pricing for Physical for Physical Call Option" \u000a\u000aDaily Pricing means the "Daily Midpoint" price set forth in Gas Daily\u000a Platts, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, or successor publication, in the column "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to the geographic location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point(s) for the relevant gas day.  If there is no single "Daily Midpoint" price published for that particular Gas Day, but there is published a "Common" range of prices under the above column and listing, then the Spot Price shall be the average of such "Common" high and low prices.  In the event that no 'Daily Midpoint" price or "Common" range of prices is published for that particular Gas Day, then the Spot Price shall be the average of the following: the price (determined as stated above) for each of the first Gas Day immediately preceding and following the Gas Day in which the default occurred for which a Spot Price can be determined.\u000a\u000aLet  me know what you think.\u000a\u000adp\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a4.5. Termination Offset.  Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, the Notifying Party may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Affected Party by the Notifying Party or any Affiliate of the Notifying Party under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by the Affected Party to the Notifying Party or any of the Notifying Party's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of the Affected Party and the Notifying Party under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by the Notifying Party and/or the Notifying Party's Affiliates.  The Notifying Party will give the Affected Party notice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section 4.5, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section 4.5 may be converted by the Notifying Party into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which the Notifying Party, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, the Notifying Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in this Section 4.5 are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section 4.5, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section 4.5 and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had entered into this Agreement as its relates to Section 4.5.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Notifying Party shall not be required to pay to the Affected Party any amount under Section 4.5 until the Notifying Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Affected Party to make any payments to the Notifying Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDeal 717768 should be kept whole.  This is a baseload purchase.  Deal 544392 should still act as the swing buyback on days that the plant underpulls.\u000a\u000aD\u000a\u000a\u000aFYI.  Anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price, the purchase should be kept whole.  Only the buybacks with Gas Daily pricing take the swings.\u000a

Golf is just like everything else, it just takes the disciple to practice and to practice correctly.  I know the tips will help me.  Keeping notes is good idea also.  Thanks, also for the golf towel.  I've got a round coming up tomorrow with a few guys from work.  Maybe I can sleep on the book tonight get a little advantage.

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , <NAME/> has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the service.  <NAME/> Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.  If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the <NAME/> estate to handle this.  The problem with <NAME/> continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Please give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aThe message below is in reference to the voice message and e-mail I sent you a couple of weeks ago.  We are serving as agent for Tenaska IV, with the duties of scheduling and settling for the fuel needs of the Cleburne plant.  In November, the plant was not running at full capacity, so we sold the excess fuel gas to TXU Fuel and TXU Gas Distribution.  In doing this, we ended up with a net payment owed to Tenaska IV (in normal months, Tenaska pays us and then we pay the suppliers and pipelines.  All profits/losses are passed through to Tenaska.  ENA receives a management fee).  Can we pay intercompany bills?  How should we go forward with this agency responsibility?  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2137
aV\u000a\u000aOk, We should be paying Dow based on the index price.  But, it should be IF HSC - .07 instead of -.06.  Sales volumes should be allocated to deal 639612.\u000a\u000aD\u000a
p2138
aV\u000a\u000aSee below.  The deal was priced at Index but entered as GD in Sitara.  This is going to give you a $75,000 hit for April.\u000a\u000aD\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey, <NAME/>.  We are in sad shape, aren't we?  I was on vacation last week, through Monday.  Not a good feeling coming back to a sub $20 stock price and an SEC inquiry.  It never really seemed possible to me that <NAME/> would be here.  Other than concerns for my future, everything is going fine.  Things really are ok, I know I can get a job with AEP if I need to.  I actually started talking to them about it.  But on Wednesday, they made a few changes that I'm not so sure about.  <NAME/> Gottlob (recently made VP) was put over the origination desk.  (I heard that they weren't too pleased with Ducoti and Bilberry.)  With that move, they needed someone else to run the trading desk.  That person is our fast-talking friend, Carey Metz.  That blew me away.  I believe their thought was that he would be the best to manage the financial risk.  Apparently he's made a ton of money since he's been in <NAME/>.  He's also going to stay in <NAME/> with this responsibility.  So, this may be the first move to bring the group up north with the rest of the family.\u000a\u000aThe home-life is going well.  We have 3 year-old soccer every Sat.  My lovely wife signed me up to be the coach.  I'm going to get her for that one.  It is fun, though.  Those kids are funny.  They don't care where the ball goes, they just keep kicking (even through the woods).  Looking forward to Halloween.  <NAME/> is going to be a policeman, <NAME/> is going to be a jailbird/prisoner.  <NAME/> has already handcuffed <NAME/> a number of times, he loves it.  My vacation last week was very good.  It was the first extended vacation that I have taken where we didn't have traveling and entertainment stuff planned.  It was one of the best vacations I have had.  We spent 2 days in San <NAME/> doing the zoo and easy stuff like that.  The rest of the week, we did things around here (like Children's Museum).\u000a\u000aBig game coming up this weekend.  Do you think your Huskers can pull it off?  I think OU's going to win it, but it should be a great game.\u000a\u000aHow about the 6,7, or 8th for lunch?  Later.\u000a\u000aD\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey <NAME/>.  Well, I'm still here for now.  It's hard to leave.  We have all taken quite a bit of time off (out all last week and a couple of days the week before that.)  I'll only be here a couple of hours today.  But we had a great Christmas.  The kids have been so excited.  I made the mistake of getting a couple of microphones/sirens for their tricycles.  You can hear them all through our neighborhood.  The neighbors have already asked my what I was thinking.  <NAME/> wanted 3 things (a play airport, a pirate ship, and Buzz Lightyear).  He got them all.  With each present, he kept getting louder and more excited.  <NAME/> was primarily interested in in opening presents, he didn't care what was in them.  That kid gets more out of ripping things up and tearing things down than any kid I have ever seen.  In fact, the other day, <NAME/> and I were stacking his big leggo blocks as high as we could go.  <NAME/> likes to make things and he likes them neat and orderly.  So, he was working hard at making this tower stand up and work (it ended up being about eight feet tall).  Well <NAME/> was chomping at the bit to run through it.  After holding him off for a few minutes, I let him go.  You should have seen his eyes light up.  You would have thought it was the biggest event of the year.  He tore through it, smiling all the way, saying "again, again."  It has been so fun spending extra time with the kids.  My mom and sister came in the weekend before Christmas.  <NAME/>'s parents and sister came in Friday.  With the couple of days between their visits, I remodeled our downstairs bathroom (strip wallpaper, paint, hung a border, hung crown molding).  That was my first try with crown molding. It turned out ok.  Thank the Lord for wood putty.  So, we've been pretty busy.  But, it's been fun.\u000a\u000aHow was your Christmas?  Was Santa Claus good to you?  I guess your kids were in.  I hope you had a wonderful time.  I'm looking forward to Corn Boys bowl game.  Anyway, I need to go make a call on a tee time.  <NAME/>'s dad and I decided that we would pay good money to get mad and lose a bunch of balls and break a few clubs, while out in the cold.  It doesn't make much sense, does it?  But then again, most things that men do don't make much sense.\u000a\u000aLater,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWe recently purchased house with a spa in the backyard. After filling with water and adjusting to the correct ph and bromine levels, the water smells like mildew.  Is there a way to treat this chemically?  I thought that the smell was coming from the cover at first. But, I have thoroughly cleaned the cover inside and out.  Could the smell be coming from the air/water lines?  It appears that the previous owners did not take care of some things around the house.\u000a\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Farmer\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked <NAME/> Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.\u000a\u000aAs far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of <NAME/> North America.  How do we get this corrected?\u000a\u000aD\u000a
p2153
aV\u000a\u000aWe are in the same building.  The move got postponed until next week.  Using the same badges.  I have the same phone #.  Parking is the same.

p2155
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aIn order to book the imbalance payback between HPL and Lobo, I have created deal 1166748 (ENA selling to AEP @ $2.45).  I have changed the price on Deal 1109140 from $0.00 to $2.455.  From what I understand, we received the gas at <NAME/> Ranch, sold it to AEP so that they would move it through the header on their contract and bought it back at a half cent difference.  Following that, we sold the gas to the central desk, who sold it to Oneok at the South Texas pool.  With the changes I made and the entries you are able to do, hopefully this deal will be wrapped up.  Let me know if you need me to do anything else.\u000a\u000aD\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI would like to recommend a promotion for <NAME/> Olsen.  <NAME/> has been instrumental to the Texas Desk.  With the sale of HPL, we were left with only one scheduler with Texas experience.  <NAME/> took on the responsibility that two people were carrying prior to the sale of the pipeline (Waha scheduling).  He trained our new hire, <NAME/> Smith, and assisted in developing scheduling processes at the <NAME/> Hub.  Prior to the sale of HPL, all of our activity at the <NAME/> hub passed through the pipeline.  <NAME/> used his knowledge of the Waha hub and helped develop a net out procedure that allowed us to effectively schedule our transactions.  Since June, <NAME/> has handled the logistics activities of the majority of Texas pipes (Westar, HPL, PGE, Channel, Oasis, Guadalupe).  <NAME/> most outstanding accomplishment is the over $30,000 he saved us in hub transport fees from July to November.  In July, I began tracking the amount of hub fees that we should have to pay in the Waha area (on EOL we transacted on the basis that the seller pays the transport fees through the hub).  <NAME/> used his knowledge of the pipes, his business relationships, and his negotiation skills to decrease the amount of gas that we scheduled under our contracts.  In essence, I kept a sort of P&L for him.  <NAME/> has taken the desks responsibilities upon himself, as if this were his business.  With the limited number of people on our desk, I needed to split my time between Logistics and Trading.  Truthfully, I spent the majority of my time with the trading.  <NAME/> handled the daily logistics responsibilities.  He acted as lead, supervising and training <NAME/>, our other team member.  <NAME/> performed at a senior level since his first month with the desk.  <NAME/> came to the desk with experience on the pipeline side of the business, accepting nominations and confirming the plants and interconnects. He came to the Texas desk and exceeded all of my expectations. He has advanced quicker than any of the schedulers I've seen.  In fact, he has gone from very minimal marketing logistics knowledge to explaining transactions and processes to other people in the industry with more experience than him.  In short, <NAME/> has been the heart of the Texas Logistics team.  His abilities and hard work have reduced our transport fees, kept our headcount low (he has fulfilled the responsibilities of two people), and enabled the Texas Desk to close time sensitive deals and transact in increasingly complicated deals.  <NAME/> is a superior employee.  His knowledge, ability, and hard work are essential to the success of the Texas Desk.  Please support him with a promotion.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need any information. \u000aThanks.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2158
aV\u000a\u000aOn Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.\u000a\u000aD\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI would like for you to move with HPL to the new building to continue training.  I spoke with <NAME/> the other day and let him know this.  Let me know if you have any concerns with this or if you have any questions.\u000a\u000aD\u000a
p2161
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, \u000a\u000aI believe that <NAME/> was going to show EEX a bid with the understanding that any deals on HPL would go with the pipeline after the sale. We were working under the thought that we need continue to conduct business as usual for HPL until the sale is finalized. The HPL piece is just a portion of supply that we are bidding on, and <NAME/> was going to present them with bids for their total package (<NAME/> and HPL).  Let me know what you want to do. If you don't want to place a bid, I will pass that on.\u000a\u000aD\u000a

I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.  For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.\u000a\u000aD\u000a

Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.  The two deals should be netted.

However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.\u000a\u000aEOL:\u000a\u000aWe continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.\u000a\u000aWe believe Dynegy created a program to mirror our cash markets on their system.

aV\u000a\u000aGene,\u000a\u000aI have a methodology that gives me the answer with 3 uses of the balance 50% of the time but requires 4 uses of the balance the other 50% of the time.\u000aAre you sure this can be done???? \u000a\u000aFor my first use of the scales, I place a total of 6 balls on the scales (3 on each side). If they balance, then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball. If they do not balance, then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball. Thus, I have reduced the possible suspects to 6 after one use of the scales.\u000a\u000aIs this the right starting point???\u000a\u000aSecond, I place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other. Two outcomes:\u000a\u000a1. If the scales do not balance, I know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and I know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. I can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales. If they balance, then the suspect left off is the odd ball. If they do not balance, I know which one is odd because I already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.  \u000a\u000a2. If the scales balance on my second use of the scales, then I have three remaining suspects (the balls left off the scales) but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. I cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales. I need two more uses. \u000a\u000aAm I close at all????\u000a\u000a\u000aI hope that you had a good trip back. Stay in touch.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.\u000a\u000aAssuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:\u000a\u000a1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less\u000a\u000a2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end\u000a\u000a3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days\u000a\u000aThe above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aIf the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto <NAME/>, the economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto <NAME/> are different than those mentioned in my prior note.\u000a\u000aBased on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured between <NAME/> LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another $4.7 MM.\u000a\u000aA second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). \u000a\u000aCabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on Cabot. \u000a\u000aEco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days after the Last Cargo of 2001). \u000a\u000aIn addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.\u000a\u000aEconomics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?\u000a\u000aIn order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do.\u000a\u000aI would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.\u000a\u000aRegards,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThe U.S. needs to establish a very, very strong ground troop presence in Afghanistan as soon as possible. Until we accomplish this, we will not win over the Afghan people who would like to be rid of the Taliban. As of today, defection is very risky and maybe almost impossible. We need bases of operation in more than one area of the country. The logistics of feeding and sheltering and supplying these troops may be difficult but not impossible. The Afghan people need our support on the ground if they are going to rise up against the Taliban. \u000a\u000aWe are currently losing the media war. If our ground troops were hailed as liberators by the Afghan people and that was broadcast all over the world, we would start winning the war of words. \u000a\u000aWe must control ground very soon. There will be casualties on our side and the American people must prepare themselves mentally. We are fighting a ruthless, brutal enemy. Our resolve must increase, not diminish, when images of our casualties begin to come across our television screens. We must take down the Taliban and Bin Laden and other terrorists around the globe or face more attacks and loss of life in the United States.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, TX\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aGood morning!\u000a\u000aI talked with <NAME/>'s assistant yesterday (he was out all day) and she said that they can't send an adjuster out without first filing a claim.  To that end, she said it's generally not a good idea to file a claim (it goes on our record) unless we know there's damage.  So, she suggested that I have a roofer come out and look for possible hail damage and, if there is damage, provide us with his estimate for repair.  Then we should file a claim if need be.  So, I'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us.  If you think we should use <NAME/>, I'll call him.  But, I feel like he might not provide us with an unbiased opinion, if you know what I mean.  Talk to you later.  :)\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aSorry I haven't been able to contact you by phone, but will try today.  Can you provide me with a list of the services and fee structures in place with <NAME/>?  I'd like to see what we had before so I can compare with what we'll need going forward.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2356
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a \u000aI'm at home today too.  Have you talked to anyone?\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2357
aV\u000a\u000aTJ,\u000a\u000aI'm giving that presentation to the Trader Track people on Wed, so it looks like I'll need to postpone the meeting yet again.  In light of what's been happening in the market, I'd like to re-schedule for next Mon.  Thanks,\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2358
aV\u000a\u000aHunt,\u000a \u000aAttached is <NAME/> Bridges' resume.  I talked with him on Fri. and mentioned you might want to talk with him as well.  I don't love him, but could use him if the best fit is East Power.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2359
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aI was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the Midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity, and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy.  My conspiracy theory...could the U.S. government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the Midwest and other regions of the country, and if so, couldn't that help explain these records?  It's kind of a crazy thought, but I'd like to explore it fundamentally (do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities, how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods, etc.)  I talked to <NAME/> about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy.  Let me know what you guys think...\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2360
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCongratulations!  Stay the course and good luck!\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>,\u000a\u000aCould you please include <NAME/> Herndon on the distribution list for Consumer Weekly?  He runs EES East Risk Management and is a VP.  Thanks, and please send him the latest edition as soon as you can.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Sturm\u000a\u000ax 3-9684\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI met this guy the other day in my neighborhood.  He's the son-in-law of the people who live at the end of my street.  He seems like a good guy in person and looks like he's been close to trading.  He's local, so I thought it might not be a bad idea to bring him in.  What do you think?\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

V\u000a\u000aHi\u000a\u000aThanks for the invitation - the day sounds great.  <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be there with bells and whistles (I have a friend coming in for the weekend so I won't be able to make it but thrilled that <NAME/> and <NAME/> are in the same class again).  Talk to you soon.\u000a
p2366
aV\u000a\u000ayes positively- this day has been horrible - I'll call you on Wed\u000a
p2367
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the form of PG&E letter that we used after consultation with LaBoeuf - it has a few more words.\u000a
p2368
aV\u000a\u000aHi \u000a\u000aSorry I can't play - Tuesday is my husband's league night. Thanks though - I really enjoyed hitting on Sat and meeting your team.  Talk to you soon.\u000a
p2369
aV\u000a\u000aI agree that Netco will also need to use WSPP and we should anticipate responding accordingly.  For general conversation, though I still think we should recommend EEI.  As we open up for contracting, I think <NAME/>, <NAME/> and I will be able to quickly identify those Caps who will only use WASP.\u000a
p2370
aV\u000a\u000aGreat - go ahead and overnight to my home (I'm assuming email is unavailable?).  Check it for early delivery and tell carrier service to leave on porch if nobody is home.  My home address is 822 Columbia Street, <NAME/> Tx., 77007. Thanks\u000a
p2371
aV\u000a\u000aHere is the slightly revised TVA Confirmation\u000a\u000aCall with any questions.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a
p2372
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aSo much wasted time and energy and the well is running dry at the same time the animosity towards <NAME/> and marketers seems only to be increasing. I like the proposal to merge the discussions but... You will recall at the WSPP meeting in Colorado I asked <NAME/> Small if he wouldn't consider merging the discussions/ contracting groups.  After a long winded story about the personal pain he has and will continue to suffer (<NAME/>'s name came up a lot), he said he did not think it would ever work.  I'm all for trying to forge this single contract approach and I think EEI members, drafting committee and all, would relish it as well.  What do you think is the next best step?  \u000a\u000aps - the meeting in San <NAME/> on the 1st is still unclear for <NAME/> based <NAME/> employees.  Terrorists Halloween scares have made everyone unlikely willing to fly.  We are trying to get <NAME/> to allow a videoconference but so far no commitment that this is OK.  Lets talk about this also.\u000a\u000aHoping not to stay the course, again.  Talk to you soon.\u000a
p2373
aV\u000a\u000aThanks again for lunch.  It's always great to talk things over with you.  As promised, here are drafts of agreements.\u000a
p2374
aV\u000a\u000aI think I am already scheduled to be there but I will be.  Thanks\u000a
p2375
aV\u000a\u000aHi <NAME/>\u000a\u000aReceived your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against <NAME/> in the US)  Maybe <NAME/> <NAME/> in London or <NAME/> Abrams (<NAME/> corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI enjoyed mine. I played  <NAME/> who plays alot of doubles also (she kept coming into net) .  The score was 6-3, 6-3.  Talk to you soon.\u000a
p2378
aV\u000a\u000athanks for the message - <NAME/> definitely pays expenses.  I will call later to confirm time and possible training session (and also HR update)\u000a
p2379
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the note - I had alot of fun on Sat. too.  I'll call you later to talk about camps - I was kind of thinking of doing a 1/2 day camp at the MET but...  The teachers name for swimming at the H is <NAME/> ... just call the regular number and ask for swimming and then leave message for her. She will call you back.\u000a
p2380
aV\u000a\u000afyi - <NAME/> is trying to put together a meeting today at 200 w LLLG to begin discussions - she will be in touch with you\u000a \u000athanks\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aAs we discussed, EWS's documentation group is having a difficult time securing signed confirms for deals between EPMI/ENA and EES.  There are currently 361 physical confirmation letters outstanding with EES. Some of these have been outstanding since November  2000.  There are 24 financial confirmation letters outstanding with EES.  Some of these have been outstanding since March  2001.  The documentation group is under alot of pressure to secure signatures on all written confirms that are set up for signature.  Accordingly, it would be very helpful if you could help us resolve this situation. Please don't hesitate to call if we can be of any help.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.\u000a
p2383
aV\u000a\u000aThanks for the message - I also had a great time.  As you can imagine, things are really busy right now but lets try in the next couple of weeks to go hit.  Talk to  you soon.\u000a
p2384
aV\u000a\u000aintercompany trades do not necessarily terminate upon bankruptcy - the parties don't have to perform but for valuation purposes the market positions are not terminated until notice is sent.  I've been talking to <NAME/> and others to help determine when we should get the trades officially terminated.  This issue needs to be addressed soon.\u000a
p2385
aV\u000a\u000aAs was discussed at the meeting, we would like to participate in the process of creating/presenting a long form of Collateral Annex. Thanks\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOh no.  In the meanwhile,\u000a\u000a<NAME/> learned to tie her shoes. Unbelievalbe , but she just did it, just like that.  I talked to her about having Ms <NAME/> help her learn and she put me to shame.\u000a\u000a<NAME/> misses you.\u000a\u000aI want to book the Broadmoor - it looks great, 3 days tennis, 1/2 day Friday, Sat and Sun, August 10, 11, 12.  Dede is booked, and I have a call in for you and me.  You'll come, right?\u000a\u000aI miss you.\u000a\u000aI signed up for a little mixed doubles on Friday night, 630 -830.

I'm looking at this am. fyi - we are likely going to move the negative ctc claim back to EES and EEMC.  That decision is also being made today.  Thanks for your help - I'll let you know what date to calculate the receivable from after I hear final confirmation from <NAME/>.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aAs you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.\u000a

p2411
aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aI think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks\u000a

p2417
aV\u000a\u000aI agree -  a fundamental assumption of the MNA is that square setoff works and that you can setoff financial and physical commodity contracts.  To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA.  From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of "the lack of mutuality" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.\u000a

Do you get to pick and choose by each stock which date to use? I'm in the office today but traveling a lot this week.  If you need to reach me after today, please leave me a message at work and I will call you back.

aV\u000a\u000aHi\u000athanks - I think we should delete highlighted language but lets confirm w CY.  Also I think we should discuss whether the definition should roll w the WSPP (see black highlighted language) - we rolled because WSPP, we thought, rolled.  Now we know it doesn't. I don't think our other products roll.  How about a brief call w you me and CY.  Sorry to add layers off confusion, but the WSPP rolling has been of gnawing frustration; hence ...\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aMy typing is so poor and slow or else a book would surely follow.  Upon <NAME/>'s return we shall revisit the thorny WSPP meeting in Colorado in the modern way, by phone for lack of my speed and agility.  (CY - I think we were starting to recap the absurdity when <NAME/> Skilling suddenly resigned).  But in the meanwhile a preview.\u000a\u000aThe EEI creep was evident when <NAME/> Small after himself, personally,  taking credit for drafting <NAME/>'s market disruption language (he said it was very time consuming to draft) proceeded to be challenged by all the EEI members who the day before had sat around the table for 2 productive hours challenging certain concepts that <NAME/> originally proposed (as a result we will be modifying our language soon since some good issues were raised).  After hearing the new issues <NAME/> threw up his arms and asked that we propose new language.  Afterwards, I spoke with <NAME/>, sorry <NAME/>, and proposed to meet with him to discuss the possibility of bringing the groups together, using the absurdity of the market disruption language discussion as good evidence of what we could achieve together.  He said theoretically that might be able to happen but he never saw it happening.  I asked why.  He said too painful.  What pain.  He said <NAME/> Stack.  I said one bad day in Newport.  He stopped talking.  He did ask if we wouldn't sit down with him and tell him line by line why we don't like the WSPP. , I think this meager offer is something we can't miss so ....

All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  <NAME/> Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not <NAME/>.  <NAME/> was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate <NAME/>'s access.

I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.  Talk about space, I GOT IT!  For now anyway.  Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.  Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.  I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.  Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.\u000a\u000aThe apartment is still pretty empty.  I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.

aV\u000a\u000aListed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.\u000a\u000aQuestions that need to be answered, \u000a	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?\u000a	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?\u000a\u000a	\u000a\u000aThe operations contact at Dominion is <NAME/> <NAME/> (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.

aV\u000a\u000aTo my knowledge that capacity is still valid.

According to <NAME/>, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".

All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  \u000a\u000aDeal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.\u000a\u000aDeal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].\u000a\u000aOther items;\u000aENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before <NAME/> declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI just got a call from <NAME/> Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.  He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.\u000a\u000a1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.\u000a\u000a2)  Sempra told <NAME/> that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.\u000a\u000aJust a thought.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI asked <NAME/> Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.\u000a \u000a<NAME/>, I gave this info to <NAME/> before he went to the cash meeting.

If it ever happens on the weekend, <NAME/> and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.  Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.\u000a\u000aIf I remember correctly, Midland would call <NAME/> and <NAME/> would call Reliant.

aV\u000a\u000aThe CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.\u000a\u000aFor the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."\u000a\u000aThe second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."\u000a\u000aFinally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."\u000a\u000aMoral: Women are evil. <NAME/>'t mess with them.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThese are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula\u000a\u000a	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price \u000a\u000aThey may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.\u000a\u000aWho knows what volumes are going to be?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI think this will do for now.  I was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and Meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me.

I've never felt the little sucker move - maybe she's just getting fat.  What do you think?\u000a\u000aWe keep loosing people.  <NAME/> is moving to the Estate Team power dispatch group.

Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  <NAME/> Goodell called <NAME/> Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  <NAME/> told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, \u000a	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper\u000a	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning\u000a	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.\u000a\u000aThis is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  <NAME/> will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOne day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.\u000a\u000aHe invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.\u000a\u000aWith every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!\u000a\u000aNow, the Moral of the Story:\u000aLife is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!\u000a\u000aRemember the five simple rules to be happy:\u000a1. Free your heart from hatred.\u000a2. Free your mind from worries.\u000a3. Live simply.\u000a4. Give more.\u000a5. Expect less.\u000a\u000aP.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.\u000a\u000aMoral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.\u000a

ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.\u000a\u000aI will be out tomorrow and <NAME/> Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, tomorrow morning, call <NAME/> Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If <NAME/> isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing <NAME/> up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  <NAME/> will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.\u000a\u000aHave a good weekend!\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aShe has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.

I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.\u000a\u000aI guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas.  I'm making the following assumptions;\u000a	1.  ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31, 2002\u000a	2.  Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months\u000a	3.  Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day\u000a\u000aSo far this month, Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day.  I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on.\u000a\u000aThe following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas.  <NAME/>, you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee.

aV\u000a\u000aIn the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and <NAME/> affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.\u000a\u000aApproving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI just spoke with <NAME/> Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.\u000a\u000aSabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and <NAME/> is giving us the gas at?

aV\u000a\u000aMaragaret,\u000aI have 2 prepays in this email.  We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.\u000a\u000aNote to all\u000aThe first prepay is to TXU.  I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.\u000a\u000aThe second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.\u000a\u000aMy goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aThis is what I want to send to our "Team".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?\u000a\u000a\u000aThese are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.\u000a\u000aSummary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.\u000a\u000aENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<NAME/>'s notes:\u000aSonat Park & Loans\u000a\u000a2/19/02  History  - Per <NAME/> Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat \u000aENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  \u000a\u000aDeal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.\u000a\u000aDeal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to <NAME/>, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.\u000a\u000aOther items;\u000aENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before <NAME/> declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.\u000a\u000aSonat's in house legal counsel is <NAME/> <NAME/> (205-325-7696).  I left a message for <NAME/> to call me.\u000a\u000a2/20/02\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> returned my call.  <NAME/> said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked <NAME/> if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  <NAME/> said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.\u000a

I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.\u000a\u000aToday we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPer my discussion with <NAME/> Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.

You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.\u000a \u000aStacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.

The March invoice is for demand charges of $.425 x 10,000 dth per day.\u000a\u000a889014		Colorado Spring Utilities				96062701		\u000aNo changes made to Sitara ticket since 6/29/01.  Per Master Letter Log - only activity with EPMI is listed, no mention of any contracts with ENA.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $7,200.00 per month.\u000a\u000a22109		Consolidated <NAME/> Company of New York	96000908\u000aLong term sale to ConEd on Tennessee pipeline.  Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - the hedge in Sitara was killed on 11/26/01.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $101,339.35 which is a percentage of the Tenn Z1 and Z0 indexes.\u000a\u000a1161432	Superior Natural Gas Company			96052897\u000aNot listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - hedge in Sitara was killed on 12/12/01.  This is a sale to Superior with a NYMX trigger, the trigger was entered in Sitara on 11/6/01 at 14:32 and the trigger price was $3.05.  The March invoice is for the difference between the trigger price of $3.05 and Nx1 for March $2.388 = $.662 x 10,000 dth per day x 31 days.\u000a\u000a1201382	TXU Fuel Company				96096343\u000aThis deal probably should not be in Sitara.  Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. to TXU.  This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk.  If Feb 2002, it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA.  I took all prices on this deal to 0.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it  \u000aAND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th\u000aAND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.\u000a\u000aIts only a diff of $80 or so.

aV\u000a\u000aI just went over the March prepayment with <NAME/> <NAME/> (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations\u000a\u000a	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00\u000a	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)\u000a\u000a						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00\u000a\u000aThere may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but <NAME/> will let us know about that later.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI just showed <NAME/> McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  <NAME/> is going to discuss this in a meeting with <NAME/> Hall today.  \u000a\u000aI guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.\u000a\u000aCan you guys think of any other questions along those lines?\u000a

I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, please chat with <NAME/> on which contract to use.

aV\u000a\u000aNothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.\u000a\u000aI hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  \u000a\u000aYesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.\u000a

I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st.  <NAME/>'t know if I'll be a married man by then or not.

aV\u000a\u000aDo my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?\u000a \u000aI can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice. I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.  Let me know what your preference is.\u000a \u000aI have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on <NAME/>'s Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).  I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.   I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aWith a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As <NAME/> mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go. \u000a\u000aNo one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.  \u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,\u000a\u000a	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)\u000a	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth\u000a	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)\u000a	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/> and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000a<NAME/> Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.\u000a\u000aENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling <NAME/> Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with <NAME/> Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;\u000a\u000a1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.\u000a2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?\u000a3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.\u000a4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).\u000a\u000a<NAME/> will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.\u000a\u000aAll of my previous notes are shown below in blue.\u000a\u000a\u000aSummary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2/19/02  History  - Per <NAME/> Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat \u000aENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  \u000a\u000aDeal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.\u000a\u000aDeal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to <NAME/>, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.\u000a\u000aOther items;\u000aENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before <NAME/> declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.\u000a\u000aSonat's in house legal counsel is <NAME/> <NAME/> (205-325-7696).  I left a message for <NAME/> to call me.\u000a\u000a2/20/02\u000a<NAME/> <NAME/> returned my call.  <NAME/> said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked <NAME/> if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  <NAME/> said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.\u000a\u000a2/25/02\u000aPer <NAME/> Mann - <NAME/> Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.\u000a1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for <NAME/> <NAME/> regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.\u000a\u000a3/11/02\u000aPer <NAME/> - <NAME/> Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  <NAME/> Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.\u000a\u000a3/13/02\u000aPer <NAME/> - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  <NAME/> called <NAME/> <NAME/> (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - <NAME/> said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  <NAME/> also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.\u000a3:30 PM  <NAME/> Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.\u000a3:40 PM  <NAME/> is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aDominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to <NAME/> Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.\u000a\u000aThis morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, <NAME/> <NAME/> (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  <NAME/> Vrana (713-752-4514) with <NAME/> <NAME/> is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  \u000a\u000aJust spoke with <NAME/> (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing <NAME/> but he has worked with Harlam <NAME/>?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aOn Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows <NAME/> changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?\u000a\u000athanks\u000a

I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, <NAME/>, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aHey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  <NAME/> <NAME/> was asking me \u000a\u000a<NAME/> has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.\u000a\u000aDeal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book\u000a592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England\u000a223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England\u000a\u000a415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1\u000a415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1\u000a1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1\u000a\u000aWhen this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give <NAME/> the NFUL transport (I don't know who at <NAME/> agreed to this).  <NAME/> pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).\u000a\u000a\u000aKam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.\u000a\u000aAlso, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI don't think the triggers are correct.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.

aV\u000a\u000aTallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.  I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.  This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.  My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.

aV\u000a\u000aI really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aI am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.  If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.  I get the estimated prices from <NAME/>.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aQuetion about March 2002, it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file, not the net volumes.  Would you check on that please sir?\u000a\u000aThanks.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aAccording to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: \u000a1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool\u000a2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead\u000a3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65\u000a\u000aMost of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.\u000a\u000aShould we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense?\u000a
p3043

aV\u000a\u000ai took the test and this is what it said.\u000acolors green blue yello purple red black white orange\u000aYou are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.\u000aYou are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.\u000aEverything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.\u000aYou are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.\u000aYou need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.\u000a<NAME/>'t date or hook yourself up with a hussy.  Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.\u000a

aV\u000a\u000aPer my discussion with <NAME/> Glazebrook at Tennessee, she wasn't real specific since I don't have an EES ID on Tennessee but this is what I found out.\u000a\u000a<NAME/>\u000a\u000aBalancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)  This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816.  This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.\u000aFirm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company\u000aGas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company\u000aGas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company   All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable.  In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.\u000aGas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)   \u000aSupply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)\u000a\u000aOf all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If <NAME/> is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that <NAME/> is still using this agreement?\u000a
