               resets to 335
               reset trigger 335
       

the mechanics of the swap are as follows  it is a normal swap at the reset swap price unless a particular reference month settles at or above the reset trigger in that case that month and only that months reference price resets to the new price as specified in resets to all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again

i get a smattering of actual i tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago and half the flight was in and out of the clouds having a good autopilot and stormscope makes a diference but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience the trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late i have the stormscope feeding through the garmin 530 keep flying
 

1 hickerson does not have any products up yet i need to find out from bridges where we are with cargill he has been in meetings all morning i will revert when i know

2 to be honest i think we are nowhere with dow but i have left that to berberian i havent heard a peep from anyone on this i will find out

3 i think it is 5050 on gm they clearly are interested but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish they do want to make markets i think our best bet is an eol product hosting deal but their internal process will be excruciating next step is they will meet with alan engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on eol

4 i have not been moving forward on service level contract because i do not think it really adds any value at the present time

5 i do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to eol this should not be viewed as a commission

6 i spoke with vin name of nymex and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals he is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week

7 rekiodex it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the developmenttesting schedule right now

8 as you know we are in receipt of the ice api we have not been able to do much work on it given 7

i think the note i sent to name plus the fact that he came to see me and i told him he was out of line are enough we will not support the app it seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information as far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than gee wouldnt this be cool i think it is time to reassess the wireless angle in terms of what it would cost to build who would build it for us and what we would get from the project im going to ask name forster to do that

i base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations when i was at bankers trust every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal can you tell us where we can get a cheap offtheshelf system that we can use to manage these things  

the problem kiodex has is exactly what you describe with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission the third party asp model is an extremely difficult one to sell there are all the obvious reasons security reliability continuity etc what kiodex needs to focus on in my opinion is the intersection of customers who need the product but dont view the function as critical to their operation

for what it is worth

it is my strong belief that kiodex will be most successful in marketing to fortune 500 corporations these companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core i am interested in your thoughts and how if you agree we can influence the company in this direction

i agree with you the first bullet point will be easier to implement generally i have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want 

my goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points i think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm but no group dedicated to it clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions

we are sending our bid and offer prices to reuters for most us gas  power products as well as european gas and power crude and refined products bandwidth coal emissions weather and sea freight

we will receive 75 of all revenue reuters collects from subscriptions to enrononline quotes it is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice we are under no obligations to provide levels of service

revenue expectations

reuters will charge initially 150monthdesktop they have 5000 energy desktops worldwide

thus with 100 penetration we would get 5000 x 150 x 12 x 75 6750000

with a more realistic assumption of 50 penetration the yield to name would be 3375000 pa

this revenue does not include the incremental benefits in our view of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace in the future i could see us adding a transactable api to the product through reuters which would enhance the ease of transaction by reuters users

if you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line

guys
lets get together today to dicuss demo i would like to demo full capability including option manager i think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only no need to convert to dollar ox just yet given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of eol i think it behooves us to slant presentation that way

i did confirm that dow is now an asset deal with no interest by dow in enw products

i think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity ie ice and think about tsomething that is at least 50 of that and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee

a bit of good news ngpl has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on enrononline
150k initial startup plus 100k per year and 25 per transaction so total value not including per transaction is 350k i think they get 5 products but forster knows the details its a start and the crew here is pretty pumped

ive been thinking about this i think 18 mos for the average tenor of a trade is way too high for name names book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months we would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for nymex gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months i think the same would probably be true for power but i havent spoken to those guys about it 

for the nymex book gas i made the following assumptions

average tenor 5 months

average trades per day 400

average volume per trade 500000 mmbtu

average px 27mmbtu

with 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of 136bn this is simply 40025250000027

you then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year if the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption

that takes you down to 6804bn 136bn2

the next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties you are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty i am working on those numbers as i write this it stands to reason that the net number for nymex gas deals would be less than 70bn when you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and i will look at that

as a basic method does this start to get you to where you need to be

this is the underlying deal it needs work and i am not sure we would do it also no straight through processing would be allowed for our deals
 

i met with name sprecher of the intercontinental exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading

1 we now have the complete api to them but it is hooked up to their test environment they will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site he assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it esentially if we trade or provide prices the api will be free if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it

2 he stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model they will try to make their money through mid and back office services

3 their purchase of the ipe is directly related to implementing 2 his vision is to use the ipe infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the fcms to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks in a nutshell he beleives the fcms are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse so why not expand their role

4 when i expressed some skepticism about 3 he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ice members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services i told him we would

i will keep you posted

this is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of close of business oct 15 2001 our treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore so for getting the term structure of names funding costs for 101501 i probably cant deliver that today i still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that i will keep trying though

openlink is one of the leaders in risk management systems we used at coral and it was then called abacus it is strongest in front office risk management i would view their competition as kiodex the deal with name has been around for awhile

glad we could hook up yesterday 

the gist of what we are interested in is providing nameonlines liquidity to local nymex traders i would like to explore the concept of nymexs clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between name and these locals nameonlines architecture provides for a master user such as a clearing corp to set up as many subusers local traders as it wants each subuser has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master we would envision the clearing corp handling it credit arrangements with the locals and negotiating its relationship with name i know this is pretty simple stuff but every long journey starts with a small step please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof

thanks

name mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate just wanted to let you know that i have a very high opinion of him he is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders ive dealt with in nontrading commercial situations when he worked for me at enrononline i always viewed him one of my best folks do what you will with this unsolicited opinion but i thought it best if i let you know

let me make this clear accenture is not to speak to anyone other than ourselves regarding what they are doing with enrononline we ahve too much at stake right now

what is exactly the state of play here  i nothing else happens on monday does the product go up on the wallboard  has eddie quoted on px to the merc  i need to have my facts straight when this becomes a pissing match between whalley name and lavorato
 

name and philippe

having listened to the dealbench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with name i would like to propose the following with respect to dealbench and enrononline

1 the most valuable pieces of business functionality dealbench has are the data rooms and auctions the first might have some going concern value but probably not much as intralinks the king only generates 10mm in revs per year the second auctions while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business

2 the technology as a whole is not severable right now and probably not ready for prime time thus the chances of getting a bid for it as ipr that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal we have some knowledge of this from our offline experiences


recommendation

enrononlines auction functionality is very thin dealbenchs has a lot of good business logic built into it while the code might not be up to our standards it would be of value to integrate it into the enrononline platform this way we take advantage of the superior enrononline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned there will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the dealbench auctions piece to accommodate the single enrononline login as well as change the look and feel to an enrononline one but this should be well worth it it is my strong belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that enrononline should own as a part of this move we should redeploy dealbenchs auction marketing force to attack this space which furthers the general commercial goals of ene as opposed to something that now is fringe at best

hi mom

things are a little better here for me friday was a horrible day we had layoffs of about 30 of our office  lots of crying and sadness on the floor   the weekend was strange name came back from name un announced which was not what we agreed to and i got the feeling that he was thinking he was going to catch me doing something or having someone over  he is still really struggling with the idea that i just cant love him like a wife anymore and that is not enough to keep two people together  i wish that i could make this easier on him and i almost think that if i had been unfaithful it would be easier for him to accept

i am just trying to hold on until he gets some kind of income so that we can sell the house and pay our debt i do not have any desire for him to be forced to live with his parents i wouldnt wish that on anyone just pray for him and for me

school sounds wonderful i am so glad you are happy dealing with your little ones how fun  

i love you

today there is a meeting from ubs in about 10 minutes i wonder what will be said i will let you know everything

on the way to work i was thinking about us planning for our home i love the sound of our home i hated seeing all of your stuff packed away today i like snuggling with your pillows when you have gone to work soon we will both just be home

hopefully i will be all done with my bullshit in time to meet you at the grotto before going to stanfords but if not i will meet you there at 6 if i make it to the grotto by 5 will that be enough time for you to pick them up as well

i am calling the doctor when his office opens to complain about the medication i hope he gives me some more meds but he might tell me just to hang in there until the new lower level is stabilized

last night was wonderful each time we are together i find something new to enjoy i love being with you holding you and feeling all of your touches and caresses you make me so happy and i want to make you happy i love that little grin on your face and the tenderness in your eyes you are a wonderful man and i am the luckiest woman in the world to have you in my life

i have the house to myself this weekend name is at your folks to give us a little space  he is still very upset and i feel bad that i have made him so sad i really didnt think he would be this upset i am glad that the family is rallying support for him and i have been kind of laying low with the family so that he can have that support he has no real friends here and that is a big problem

i love you

i have not confirmed that these are the correct values but this should get you started  these are based on socals published longterm storage tariff  i cannot confirm whether socal has capacity at these rates available to sell  keep in mind i dont think the lng project would incur the entire cost of the storage as ena could extract additional value from optimizing its operation  it appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights which i do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter  please do not hesitate to call with any questions

per our conversation the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to trackcomputereport etc


name

the west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports  these balances are not reported by the respective pipelines however each day the injections and withdrawals are available  in the past our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior days balance  as we get validation of the balances through phone calls andor postings we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation  currently our reportingstorage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports

name

synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table  it is our intent to have a drn established and some already have been created that would hold the storage balance each day  however this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database  one possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped  another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity  lastly these storage balances could be manual entry points but would require manual calculation each day representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature

name

this is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets  at a minimum we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week  although we do not have a final date for transitioning we see this as one of a few critical tasks

for the following dates we do not have cycle 7 data in the database for pge pipeline 17  these should have been reloaded from the saved html files  do we have these files and if so can you load the appropriate dates in order the get the cycle 7 data in for these points


2801
3701	
3801	
3901	
31001	
31101	
31201	


for the following dates the data we have for cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains  we need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct and if it isnt get it corrected  i could check them if you could print out the saved pages for me	

21201
22701 
3101 
41101 	
41601 	
41701

the attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced southwest gas meter points off of el paso kern and pge  as i indicated earlier swg may have deliveries off of socal which we would not be able to see  also there may be unidentified swg meter points not included in the attached file and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher  finally if this data is used for pricinghedging analysis one should be careful which prices they use for comparison  swg territory in california would be subject to california pricing while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently  in addition southwest gas owns transport capacity on el paso such that they were really only vulnerable to san name or keystone price fluxuations and not socal  you could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity which i do not it is available on el pasos website  anyway thats all i have

the buddha says that we take wisdom where we find it perhaps the buddha does not say that but its not a bad idea anyway the buddha would have said it maybe had he not been saying the other things 
our enemies can teach us lessons our adversaries can make us stronger they can be consumed with greed and contempt their very breath can be toxic and yet their actions can open upwardflowing paths
take name the energy company or chevron another energy company or el paso natural gas yet another energy company these organizations are the minions of satan they pillage and they profit they are in the ascendant their enemies fall before them like cordwood ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute 
and yet we thank them we send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail but we thank them they have shown us the nature of our enslavement they have defined the nature of our sloth 
we have believed the big lie we have believed in the free lunch we have trusted those who would pander to us we have eaten energy in great dripping gobs did we know it was not infinitely renewable oh yes did we understand that energy companies could create shortages whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for maintenance you bet we did and did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations andor alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature we did not 
but it was more convenient to forget those things and so we did we have busy lives we must do the things we must do the infrastructure is everywhere crumbling and we are patching it up ourselves we are paying bureaucrats with taxes but the bureaucrats are inadequate so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised 
volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but dont 
and somehow even in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one we forgot about our own checking accounts already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didnt need 
im not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones  im talking about washing machines with quarterfull loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand right lights burning in unoccupied rooms appliances plugged in but never used 
we pay for it we send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in american commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else you wonder why they have contempt for us you wonder why name cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time because he has 
look last week the secretary of commerce suggested meanstesting social security  that is meanstesting a pension plan you gave us the money we kept it for 40 years now  prove that you need it 
why did he suggest that because he can why did pge demand additional compensation for its executives who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition because they can get away with it they will get away with it you watch 
i am not saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves there are active villains and there are people who allow villainy to occur everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt the fools are the ones who dont end up with any extra money 
we are the fools if we understand our foolishness we begin to be wise we send lovely breadandbutter notes to name  once we were blind but now we see and we await developments or create them
 

nothing set i was thinking of just trying to walk onto herman or memorial or any coarse for that matter i just want to play

there are two outcomes
1	everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2	everyone is pissed bc they drove 100 miles  they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole  finish the round and never mention
	your name again

glad to see you working on some good stuff  

you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles that you were given
and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the resonableness of the model
models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions

good luck

hi name  

at this time i do not know of a rotation on the nymex desk
both name and myself are both associates currently on the desk that will not be rotating
for some time now

name
 

 america  the good neighbor

 widespread but only partial news coverage was given
 recently to a remarkable
 editorial broadcast from toronto by name sinclair
 a canadian television
 commentator  what follows is the full text of his
 trenchant remarks as
 printed in the congressional record


 this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
 americans as the most
 generous and possibly the least appreciated people
 on all the earth
 germany japan and to a lesser extent britain and
 italy were lifted out of
 the debris of war by the americans who poured in
 billions of dollars and
 forgave other billions in debts  none of these
 countries is today paying
 even the interest on its remaining debts to the
 united states
 when france was in danger of collapsing in 1956 it
 was the americans who
 propped it up and their reward was to be insulted
 and swindled on the
 streets of paris
 when earthquakes hit distant cities it is the
 united states that hurries in
 to help this spring 59 american communities were
 flattened by tornadoes
 nobody helped
 the name plan and the name policy pumped
 billions of dollars into
 discouraged countries  now newspapers in those
 countries are writing about
 the decadent warmongering americans
 id like to see just one of those countries that is
 gloating over the
 erosion of the united states dollar build its own
 airplane  does any other
 country in the world have a plane to equal the
 boeing jumbo jet the
 lockheed tristar or the name dc10  if so why
 dont they fly them
 why do all the international lines except russia fly
 american planes
 why does no other land on earth even consider
 putting a man or woman on the
 moon you talk about japanese technocracy and you
 get radios  you talk
 about name technocracy and you get automobiles
 you talk about american
 technocracy and you find men on the moon  not
 once but several times 
 and safely home again
 you talk about scandals and the americans put
 theirs right in the store
 window for everybody to look at  even their
 draftdodgers are not pursued
 and hounded  they are here on our streets and most
 of them unless they
 are breaking canadian laws are getting american
 dollars from ma and pa at
 home to spend here
 when the railways of france germany and name were
 breaking down through
 age it was the americans who rebuilt them  when
 the pennsylvania railroad
 and the new york central went broke nobody loaned
 them an old caboose
 both are still broke
 i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced
 to the help of other
 people in trouble  can you name me even one time
 when someone else raced to
 the americans in trouble  i dont think there was
 outside help even during
 the san name earthquake
 our neighbors have faced it alone and im one
 canadian who is damned tired
 of hearing them get kicked around  they will come
 out of this thing with
 their flag high  and when they do they are
 entitled to thumb their nose at
 the lands that are gloating over their present
 troubles  i hope canada is
 not one of those
 stand proud america


this is one of the best editorials that i have ever
 read regarding the united states  it is nice that one man realizes 
it
  i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it  we are 
always
 blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things 
we
do
 i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as 
you can
 and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends 
until
 this letter is sent to every person on the web  i am just a single
name
 that has read this



 

name
 
they name early told me that you have already been contacted that the money would come over 
they told me that it would
 
name
 

no change on the numbers i gave you the last time
the settlement last night was about 0025 cents to low for that term 
the settle was 3196
 

gas is back off 5 cents right now and longer term gas is off 65 cents

he is there from 9 until 2 on sat 


i will let you know when later today
 

good luck on getting it all done baby  just get the deals done and the money is secondary
do not be so hard on yourself  just figure out home much it is to your pocket book to put it all in a
reasonable perspective

there is a file under netco for all currently unused books rolls and hedge strips  oermsermsadmnetcounused books  rather than deleting these they will remain here until they are needed  the ngpl will link to these once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated  

there is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files 

we should also start creating a common file for each region to post the pl to the website  lets try to keep these the same format  east has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift  west used a macro to pull in finished pls instead of updating links which eliminated some problems randy could help with this  figure out what format you want and use that for all regions   i think everyone agrees that we dont want to give them a positions file like in the past they should use tds for that 

i believe the trv website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report s then

now that the auction is underway and the possibility of being purchased in very high we need to get back in gear today

1	everyone needs to be here no later than 800am 730 once we start trading again
2	no playing on the internet or other games ex cards  this will no longer be tolerated
3	i have said this many times before but this is the ideal time to learn
		bring in your options books or anything else that you can read to learn more about the energy industry
		start studying the firms rolls learn what the macros do develop new checks and balances
		become more familiar with forwards and options details and other excel queries and where the curves come from
		understand the curve files these will change but the general format will be similar
		
just to be clear this is coming down from name gossett  
the list for netco is not set in stone and can be changed if someone steps up or if someone doesnt

we are still getting paid everyday and should be putting our time into the company
i know it has been boring but things need to change starting today things will start to pick up in the next few days

the current restart date is january 21 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14th

i would like to get your ideas for changesimprovements to our current processessystems  we have a slightly improved firm roll to use but nothing else has changed
this is our chance to change the things we couldnt before  there is no reason why we have to continue doing things the same as before

please seriously think about this over the next few days and get back to me with any ideas you have no matter how small every little bit helps

come talk to me if you have any questions or concerns

i started looking at the prompt month positions yesterday and noticed that many of the deals moved to the bankruptcy book have not been deleted in sitara  i dont think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months  i started comparing the bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc and fixed as much as i could for the east and west i just started on central but we should check this all again on monday  because of this we have not reported any prompt month physical value  the rates group hasnt been around to get the demand charges either  we should have everything clean to report it on monday

going forward i guess we need to show people how to check it correctly

see you on monday

this amused me this morning

once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road suddenly a brand new porsche screeches to a halt the driver a
man dressed in an armani suit cerutti shoes nameban sunglasses tagheuer
wristwatch and a name cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd if i can
tell you how many sheep you have will you give me one of them

the shepherd looks at the young man then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies okay

the young man parks the car connects his laptop to the mobilefax enters a
nasa webster scans the ground using his gps opens a database and 60 excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables then prints out a 150page
report on his hightech miniprinter he turns to the shepherd and says

you have exactly 1586 sheep here

the shepherd answers

thats correct you can have your sheep

the young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his porsche the
shepherd looks at him and asks

if i guess your profession will you return my animal to me the young man
answers yes why not

the shepherd says you are an it consultant

how did you know asks the young man

very simple answers the shepherd

first you came here without being called second you charged me a fee to tell
me something i already knew and third you dont understand anything about my
friggin business now can i have my dog back

i was part of the greatest team i have ever seen or heard of we had unmatched talent and skill we had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon we consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve but above all an unbreakable commitment to help make name online great throughout the decline we did what we had always done  we did our best 
      name took my 401k they took my stock options they took away the dayold pastries that were always on the desk outside my office  they took away my boss and my coworkers whom i considered a family i loved my job and in the end they took that too  name hommel  former name employee      	
we have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at name and we all know the names of those to blame at the end of it all the truth is that bad things happen for myself i humbly asked for only one thing the chance to rebuild name online i waited all day praying that i would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted around 9 pm i got the call from the senior director that i hoped was good news in the utmost professional manner i was informed that there was no good news 
now its over i still get a bit choked up when i think about it i dont work at name and the team that i was a part of has been scattered in the streets i made some good friends at name but i know i wont see many of them again name took those friendships name took my 401k they took my stock options they took away the dayold pastries that were always on the desk outside my office they took the free sodas and the big screen tvs and the foosball table they took away the free dinners we got on friday nights during the new releases to the web site they took away the admin who always teased me because i ate like a pig and never gained weight they took away the guy that beat me in foosball 51 despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played they took away my boss and my coworkers whom i considered a family i loved my job and in the end they took that too 
but let me say this i have my memories i am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal i am going to keep my memories they belong to me

	development		name webb
	enrononline		webb  forster
	hr			name oxley
	cash management	name myers

the rest will be completed shortly

we now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus name and i would like to receive the plans restartintegration  plans by january 7th 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups  the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible  i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help  please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually

customer side	
	customers		phase  1  first week eg top 10
				phase  2  first month eg top 50
				phase  3  first quarter eg top 100
	action plan		phase  1 customers
				phase  2 customers
				phase  3 customers
	contracts by customers preprepared with credit terms etc
	customer visit schedule

product side
	list of products	phase 1  first week
				phase 2  first month
				phase 3  first quarter

target number of transactions
	phase 1
	phase 2
	phase 3

canada appears to be an issue

we need to make swift progress on this  unlike in the us the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be ubs ag london division but ubs warburg energy canada ltd  with the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from ubs this is going to be an issue

there are two main points because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers

please let me know how we can progress on this

forster is  running one of the power origination groups give hime a ring
 

lets get some time tomorrow

essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain  name has decided that name will run a group including market risk credit risk and research  things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders

lets discuss more i do have some other details for you too
 

as you know i have business flights home each year under my contract  as i will be unable to travel to the uk due to the requirement to be in name over the holidays i intend to use them for my parents borther and sisterinlaw  any difference in the cost i intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether name intends to meet expense payments
 

can you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately  at their cost as it is late whatever they can of the order
 

ees  the ena ones are still on hold  i really am not concerned about ees and retail  i spoke to muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant  there is very little left to carve out

firstly  i never pick up voicemail so i just got your message from the weekend  sorry

anyway enrononline  there are two versions today  we keep one in newco and the estate keeps one  two teams can be allocated for each
it works  we have enough people to do it

in terms of the estate
the estate will keep a copy of the source code and the estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained  the source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately  we actually have two nameonline environments today  the staging environment and the real production environment  essentially we would leave the staging environment for name  it is simply a question of staffing which i believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to newco and the name estate

in terms of newco
enrononline will be maintained for newco using the production environment  with its own staff
 

the meeting has been confirmed

they told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does i think differ slightly from integration

have i missed any critical group

bit of an issue here  i had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature  i really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market

we also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high 

please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them

why cant i consume alcohol on atkins you should not drink alcohol during induction but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the ongoing weight loss premaintenance and maintenance phases of the atkins nutritional approach when given the choice your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat but alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do 
alcohol consumption may also increase yeastrelated symptoms such as bloating gas and cravings for sweets and can therefore interfere with weight loss beer which contains yeast probably has the most yeastforming components of any alcohol an occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice scotch and other grainbased spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems 
note use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar seltzer club soda mineral water and nonaspartame diet sodas are better alternatives
 

i need a description of each of these assets asap  no more than one sentance on each  before 915am if possible on email so i can pick it up on blackberry

for diary

by th eway was i invited to a prc committee meeting last week  i dont seem to have heard of it but lavo said it was on wednesday or thursday
 

i just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today  i know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward  unfortunately i do not see things getting much easier during our startup months but i really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully well have a lot of fun along the way

the commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers

thanks for your late and long hours 

name
 

not included in the schedule is the 300mm of lcs expiring on 1130  just so you know  but i think the decision is obvious
 

a  nameonline has been a extremely successful ecommerce project in the energy industry  as of september 14 2001 it has completed over 14 million transactions worth 800 billion  currently 60 of names transactions are done via nameonline and the companys transaction costs have been reduced by 75    

our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong  we built enrononline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts  over the past 22 months we have successfully the enrononline ecommerce platform to  

1 access new markets and customers
in addition to enhancing its natural gas and power businesses nameonline has enabled name to get into other markets for example broadband paper freight metals weather petrochemicals and even financial instruments from all over the world  the system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or facetoface meetings  

2 manage high volume of products and transactions
name does more than 5000 online transactions in an average day  before nameonline a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices now she can go to nameonline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a marketdriven price with no transaction fee  the easier price discovery attracts more companies to nameonline  more trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads resulting in better prices and more deals for name

to paraphrase smart business september 2001 a longterm gas contract that in 1981 took two years to execute and in 1997 took two weeks  now takes less than a second online thanks in part to nameonline  because of the technology and software nameonline has developed it is relatively easy for name to add new products to trade online further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long leadtimes required to develop new systems
 
3 improve competitive position and bottom line

nameonline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively  the results have been widely reported in the media  internet week october 2000 name is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the internet  having whipped its existing businesses into online ones ridden the net into many new markets added 60 billion in revenue last fiscal year and has beaten wall street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year    names second quarter net income rose 40 from the yearearlier quarter to 404 million on 196 percent higher revenue of 50 billion    the internet trading marketplace name launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency nameonline now does more than 4 billion a day in trades in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives 

name was praised in smart business magazine september 2001 as no 1 of the smart business fifty list for successfully embracing the net to expand and enhance the business  

forrester research forrester report april 2001 predicts online energy trading will explode from a 400 billion market in 2000 with nameonline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades to 36 trillion in 2005  name leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor

ok  this isnt dying  i understand all the usual problems but i am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis  west desk name baughman and vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow  slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate  is it purely staffing  can we help

name
 

the gas contracts we need include the following can you give us timescales i understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out  name i believe has put you in charge or gas please could you give us a timescale
 

the lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin  have we covered this function
 

attachment shows where we ended up  i really dont think it helps if we have customers read only on eol how does that hurt us  it certainly helps them  i think you have a publicity nightmare too 
we should probably talk but i am more of the opinion well take anyones credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially


aep sent us a very threatening letter  way outside of their contractual rights

dear name

i apologize for not having responded earlier but i do not think i received the invitation which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment  we have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business i jointly manage to ubs warburg and in fact i am planning to relaunch enrononline under our new entity and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in germany

i am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in february combining the integration with ubs and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner

i appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but i do not feel able to accept

i hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to germany

lucci name t


i guess i have to start with saturday night when we met up with dax and michelle at the horsetrack  i have to admit that i wasnt looking forward to it since i didnt know how she was going to act and if she was going to be bitchy  about 15 minutes after we got there we passed on the way to the betting counter and she pulled me aside and was so very cool  she kept asking are you ok and almost seemed to sympathize with me  she said she didnt say anything to dax and would never say anything to him  she was so cool about it i was totally shocked  so on sunday dax calls and says they are going to bw3 so after a couple of hours we go up there to meet them  i walk in and missy and don were there so i was a little surprised    after we had been there for a while z laura devon and michelle go to play darts leaving me and missy at the table  so starts saying so you arent going to email me anymore and acting all sad  then she said i didnt have any balls  later don is talking about the heisman and what the statue looks like and she looks at me and says i am not giving you the heisman i guess you could say i am giving you the antiheisman and motions as if to open her legs  it was funny as shit  she also said she dumped dale but i dont know that i completely buy that  anyway all together it was very interesting weekend  i dont know that i could ever trust missy to be discrete so while it is very tempting it is also very dangerous
 

name said he is getting a big group of people to go to renaissance festival nov 3  which i know is when coon ass et all is coming in town so thought that might be something fun to do for everyone although 20 is kinda steep
 

i talked to both carmax and honda and basically all we need to do is go in before 5pm so carmax can talk to honda and bring your info for the loan  they call honda and get a payoff which is 405010 and then cut us a check for the difference  we should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the name from name
 

i called time warner and basically we were on a 6 month trial package of hbo and showtime for 995  after 6 months the rate goes to 1295  they charged us for hbo showtime and cinemax which should be 1695 but they overcharged us in addition to the fact that we dont currently get cinemax  i went ahead and ordered the 3 channel package with cinemax and they are crediting us for 1995 for the overcharge  going forward the package will be 1695 or we can cancel cinemax and save 400 a month

i spoke to you a couple of months ago about purchasing an american drew bedroom furniture set  at the time i was purchasing the furniture from a company in north name after trying to get a competitive deal from one of your stores  we had a very frank discussion about being competitive and you stated that you would be very competitive with any future purchases and i would like to take this opportunity to take you up on that offer if it still stands  after several unexpected delays i have canceled my order and received a full refund from the north name company  if you can get to a price close to the price we discussed before i would like to purchase the furniture from you immediately  i am sure you are busy however if you or a manager of one of your stores can call me i would like to discuss purchasing the furniture  you can reach me at 7138535933 at work or on my cell at 7134327163  
 
thanks

fuck them bizzzitches  i gots a passport 8500 arriving thursday  on the serious side  if you are really interested about that car i guess we should go to sterling mccall and test drive one and check it out  it is better to go there so you can find out what the new ones go for and if you are really getting a good deal  let me know
 

when does the cash portion of my signing bonus get paid  i thought it was the first pay period after it was signed but maybe i am confused  also since the raise was effective starting sept 1 will they issue a separate check for the difference between the base salary

 god finally gives shoutout back to all his niggaz httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731headgodgivesshoutoutgif


      south bronx nythe lord almighty finally responded to nearly two decades of praise in hiphop album liner notes monday when he gave a shoutout back to all his loyal niggaz

 	   httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731godgivesshoutoutjpg	
above rappers method man and redman give big ups to god inset 	

      right about now i want to send a shoutout to each and every nigga whos shown me love through the years said the lord his booming voice descending from name i got mad love for each and every one of you niggaz yall real niggaz out there you know who you are yall was there for me and its about time ima give some love back to gods true crew

      all yall niggaz yall be my niggaz the lord added

      as of press time god has thanked nearly 7000 of his niggaz including those in new yorks bad boy and ruff ryders posses the no limit soldiers and cash money millionaires holdin it down in new orleans nelly and the whole st lunatics crew busta and the rest of the flipmode squad his peeps from back in the day and all the real ruffneck niggaz in lockdown he also sent shoutouts to everybody in the old school as well as to lil bow wow and all the other new niggaz just coming up

      mad props to p diddy namez dmx lil name mystikal name ja rule jadakiss trick daddy and xzibit and one love to meth rza gza ghostface and the rest of my real niggaz in the wutang clan the deity said these my beloved niggaz with whom i be wellpleased

      now nearing the 48hour mark the lords firstever reciprocal shoutout shows little sign of slowing down based on estimates of the number of rappers who have thanked him in liner notes over the past 20 years hiphop experts say the historic shoutout is likely to continue through early next week

      in addition to raps current stars god offered shoutouts to the original hiphop heads including such pioneers of the art form as grandmaster flash busy bee namele name jazzy name kool moe dee afrika bambaataa dj red alert the cold crush brothers fab 5 name name blow kool herc and the funky 41

      god also offered shoutouts to the many djs record labels magazines tv shows and radio stations that have tirelessly supported hiphop over the years among them are def jam name boy jive rocafella rap pages the source right on the box funkmaster flex name lover and dr dre wbls 1075 kissfm and hot 97

      for supporting the many artists who have supported me so faithfully i say thank you god said all praise to name harrell name simmons lashell name and everybody else at uptownmca for making this possible

  httpgraphicstheonioncompics3731godgivesshoutoutjumpjpg	 	
above a pair of shoutout tablets handed down by the lord 	

      as a further sign of his love for the hiphop community god assured the nations rappers that he is taking good care of all their peers currently with him in heaven

      tupac notorious big eazye name larocksome of yall niggaz are already up in this bitch the lord said for those of you who were left behind know that the lord has got your dead homies backs name evans i promise im taking real good care of your biggie he resting in crazy peace no doubt

      thus far god has not played favorites thanking such fallenoff acts as hammer and vanilla ice in the same breath as vital artists whose careers are still going strong the lord has also seen fit to thank the littleknown likes of baby tragic dj phreek name and da ill collectormcs so obscure that virtually no one within the hiphop community has heard of them all rappers god explained are equal in his sight and none are too small to escape his notice

      god sees even the smallest sparrow fall said dr name west harvard university professor of africanamerican studies and philosophy of religion the same is true of mcs whether a major superstar or a complete unknown all rappers are his children and he loves them all

      the sheer volume of names notwithstanding the nations rappers are deeply touched by gods gesture of tribute and appreciation with many stating that they feelin him

      god is the original namebased rapper mos def said the world is ruled by the wealthy and the wicked but all respect due to the creator who made this world and who will one day bring justice to the wicked and righteous alike

      despite the overwhelmingly positive response among rappers the lord is drawing fire in certain circles for his use of the word nigga on mondays name name live conservative activist rev name butts a longtime ally of the lord blasted him for his shocking unexpected use of the racially loaded nword some concerned parties including decency crusader c name name sen orrin hatch rut and members of the san namebased what about the children foundation are calling for a boycott of church services until god issues an apology

      reacting to the controversy many in the hiphop community are rushing to the lords defense

      the word nigga means different things depending on how its used and whos saying it rap legend and public enemy frontman name d said judging from context god obviously wasnt being derogatory he was using nigga as a blanket term of affection for all his true supporters on the rap scene at one point he said i wanna give a shoutout to adname mc serch and my man name the automatorall yall is real niggaz in my allbenevolent sight considering the fact that adname and serch are jewish and the automator is asianamerican its clear god isnt talking about race here hes just paying respect to all those who have paid respect to him

      gods the ultimate playa so naturally hes going to have some haters rapper ice cube said but these haters need to realize that if you mess with the man upstairs you will get your ass smote true dat

i am not sure if names food service department manages the starbucks but you do i would like to report a continuous problem  starbucks has always charged a premium price for a premium product  recently the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable  very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it  it tastes horrible and i know it isnt just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt  today i bought a large coffee and by the time i returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible  i went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed  then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed  it was just as bad  it tastes and smells horrible  something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesnt deserve a price of a 25 much less over 100

there is a very good website for getting information regarding current events  wwwdrudgereportcom  i highly recommend you read it if you want to get the real scoop about what is going on in the world trade center bombings  as to who is responsible there is almost overwhelming evidence that osama bin laden was heavily involved if not the mastermind andor financier  if you are interested   read the article below that gives a breakdown on who is believed to be responsible
osama bin laden is a terrorist that has targeted american people before embassy bombings in 1998 and attack on uss name in yemen earlier this year and it would be in americas best interest to end his reign of terror by ending his life


us focuses on bin laden links with hizbullah arafats fatah 
 
special to world tribunecom
friday september 14 2001
washington  the united states is investigating whether a coalition of palestinian iranian and lebanese groups joined to help launch the suicide attacks in new york and washington

us defense sources said the pentagon and cia are quickly coming to the conclusion that saudi billionaire fugitive osama bin laden was the sponsor of the attack but they said bin laden is believed to have used a range of islamic groups for logistics and support

the groups being investigated include the fatah movement headed by palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat the sources said another group being examined for a link to the us attacks is the iranianbacked hizbullah middle east newsline reports

most of it today points to osama bin laden sen name grassley the ranking republican on the senate finance committee said but the speculation at the end of the road is that he and his network were very much involved with hizbullah fatah and other

grassley was one of at least two dozen house and senate members who were briefed by us intelligence agencies since the bombing

a us official confirmed that the administration has not ruled out that bin laden was provided aid by a range of arab and islamic groups but the official said no determination has been made

we want to be sure we understand all the connections not just one connection the official said as we find out who actually perpetrated the crime as we find out who theyre connected with as we find out who could be considered harboring them i think itll come clear

analysts and some congressional sources said the bush administration appears unwilling to thoroughly investigate the involvement of iraq in the us attacks they said that the administration fears that targeting iraq would dash hopes for an arab coalition against terrorism in the middle east

defense secretary name rumsfeld said the united states has not yet determined who was behind the bombing rumsfeld said a determination would have to be made soon

the administration has requested 20 billion for a counterterrorism campaign defense secretary name wolfowitz said much of the requested allocation would prepare the military for an expected counterattack

i dont think we know the breakdown yet partly because the needs are so enormous wolfowitz said a significant piece of this is going to be to bring our armed forces to the highest level of preparedness

the house we live in is about 1700 sq foot older home that needed some fixing up  at the time i thought we paid too much however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home  the name texans a very original name have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake  also they have totally redone south main blvd creating a nice thoroughfare the area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood  however home values go up and down just like the stock market  most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there

when we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare i think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job  i prefer to do it myself i like the way it looks when i do it and it is whole lot cheaper  one day the contractor almost died in the house he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of advil to ease the pain however he did this on an empty stomach  he had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week  he ended up returning and finishing the job  anyways i have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time i will have a better idea on how to get things done  it was hard to organize and quality assure the job since i had just started a demanding job here at name  all in all i think france or us you run into the same types of problems with contractors

 heart doctor  mechanic
 
 a mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the motor of a
 harley when he spotted a worldfamous heart surgeon in his
 shop the heart surgeon was waiting for the service manager
 to come take a look at his bike the mechanic shouted across
 the garage hey doc can i ask you a question
 
 the famous surgeon a bit surprised walked over to the
 mechanic working on the motorcycle
 
 the mechanic straightened up wiped his hands on a rag and
 asked so doc look at this engine i also can open hearts
 take valves out fix em put in new parts and when i finish
 this will work just like a new one so how come i get a
 pittance and you get the really big money when you and i
 are doing basically the same work
 
 the surgeon paused smiled and leaned over and whispered
 to the mechanic
 try doing it with the engine running

1224 16aug2001 rsfcanada blisters under year with too much summer

    by kanina holmes
    winnipeg manitoba aug 16 reuters  canadians sometimes divided by regional differences economic disparities or linguistic snits find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon  a national drought
    from atlantic to pacific from the arctic to the us border most of the worlds secondlargest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades
    in many ways this drought is the same tune thats being played right across the country its a different look different season and different impact but nevertheless everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country said name phillips a senior climatologist with environment canada
    whether its fires raging in the forests of british columbia and quebec barren prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in ontario many will remember the summer of 2001
    itll be memorable for the wrong reasons i think too much excess and not enough normal said phillips
    in parts of british columbia water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winters record low snowfall in the mountains
    weve had normal summer in terms of rain but we knew back in march with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble said name mattison water management director for bcs bureau of sustainable resources
    but the devastation is most apparent in canadas breadbasket the prairies many farmers especially in southern name and saskatchewan have already written off their crops
    ive been here since 63 i have never in my life ever seen anything like this name stienwand a farmer in castor name told reuters
    its beyond your imagination
    theres no water the grasshoppers are so bad its beyond your imagination said stienwand who farms 1080 hectares 2700 acres of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle
    it has been so sweltering in his region located about 160 km 100 miles west of the saskatchewan border that some of stienwands farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock
    its just going to destroy a lot of farmers theyre just not going to come out of it he said
    in june the name government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds and as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality
    last week the canadian wheat board the marketer of western canadas wheat durum and barley crops forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports
    in ontario canadas most populous province prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see
    you wouldnt be able to fill a sardine can with the rain theyve got since the twentysecond of june said phillips
    the drought has created ideal conditions for billions of asian aphids to infest ontarios soybean crop
    i drive by and actually now i just shut my eyes and pretend i dont see it its just really really really dry said name yuck a farmer who lives near ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks
    when they come on the radio every morning and say its a beautiful sunny day great to be at the cottage i think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours said yuck
    canadas largest city toronto has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog with temperatures soaring as high as 37 c 99 f some ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards
    an ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer
    the year with too much summer
    i wish i could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling said phillips a senior climatologist with environment canada who tracks national weather patters
    i would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer
    the hot dry spell could be a blow to the national economy by the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops aiding farmers battling forest fires and generating more electricity it could run into the billions
    quebecs multibilliondollar agricultural sector which accounts for some 16 percent of the canadian industrys revenues and produces 38 percent of the countrys milk has also been hard hit since early july
    in southern quebec where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sunravaged crops
    the farmers are on the edge of burnout they can barely stand up said name stcyr a spokesman for quebecs powerful agricultural union
    the atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat the result of massive high pressure systems in the united states that for weeks have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north
    clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on name name island growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop blueberries in nova scotia and new brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins
    i think there are a majority of canadians probably who can hardly wait for the winter and i never thought id ever hear that said phillips

hey homes
got a message from who i thought was you and hoopties last weekend hooptie left message that you and him wanted to talk to me anyways returned the call but did not hear from you homies 

anyways i had an extended vacation in brazil due to the terrorist attacks  we ended up staying there for a week and half  let me know how things are going

name


i have asked name to set up a meeting with you and name on this subject  i thought there were exclusions relative to eol transactions and points that do not directly impact hpl  the problem for me is that if i want to do terms deals in these locations now i want to be able to keep them as ena and not transfer them with the hpl sale  lets talk as soon as possible so i can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ena now and after the close

thanks

name
 

i received notice today that name villareal  name lamphier and name gottlob have accepted jobs with aep as part of the sale of hpl not to leave until closing    this means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows

1 lead physical trader
1 physical trader
1 basis trader or at least an asst trader

1 industrialutility middle marketeroriginator
1 supply middle marketeroriginator

i met with name slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer
i am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates andor internal commercial personnel

i delivered employment contracts to name wallis name schwieger stacy neuweiller name bass and name farmer  they all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it  name did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it  i know that she has been contacted by companies other  than aep about job opportunities and i know other name units have talked to her as well

although we met names numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options ill keep working on him

the others i did not get any read on but i will talk to them next week

given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the hpl transaction i want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the texas desk

i will follow up with you when i return from vacation on monday march 19th

thanks

name
 

thanks for the info  i wanted to pick your brain about cars for mom and dad  my initial research of large cars and luxury cars in consumer report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me

  i only considered cr recomended  cars  there are a few options in the 20000 to 25000 range for example the ford crown namemecury grand name but i do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to  the only car in the 30000 to 35000 range is the buick park avenue which i think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but im not sure they want to spend this kind of money  of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example the name town car and cadillac deville are in the 40000 to 45000 range

dad said he spent 23000 for his olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks  my plan at this time is to focus on the crown namegrand name and the park avenue first and see if they come close to meeting mom and dads needs

any thoughts

love

if you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at thompsonville with eex during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with aep done  i thought that there were some unique financing issues that required name to retain the transaction  it appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with hpl it should probably go with the sale  i just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep name whole  any thoughts

i talked to lambie our resident produciton and reserve expert about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons apparently if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will water out either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays also it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well 100500 mmd in names opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in name this helps let me know if you learn anything further

i have already spoken to the riv and canada customs my car was manufactured in japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 61 the gst and excise and import costs

purchase price  35000 usd  54000 cnd
duty on this amount  3300
gst on this amount  3800
excise tax  180
permits  400

plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions from riv  approx 500

that brings us to 8200 cnd plus the cost to actually transport it from name to calgary at least 2000 total approximately 10000 cnd

hardly seems like the best option

also i called name moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year and the invoice just for the move of my household goods from calgary to name was 4700 usd just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be

movers  7300 cnd 4700 usd
flight  1500 cnd
hotel  1500 cnd
october rent  1500 i have a 1 year lease in name that expires at the end of october

spoke with name glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting the concept is that a deal flows into a website that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped if it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund bill track etc name could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim 

lets review presentation then discuss with namename and name d  and proceed to banks name is clearing idea with name we are shooting for a friday 23 meeting

name  thanks for your note following are my thoughts first i am not going to netco long story second i have spoken with name lay and name mcmahon about the continuation of rac and my leading it they both want rac to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with rac as well to be determined more definitively 

name has also requested that some rac folks be near his operation as you have which i totally understand i think i will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28 we have counterparty credit files on 15000 counterparties as well as dash libraries and other info that require large secure space

my final issue is that i have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical i need to get netco people away from 28 and get remaining rac people sitting together and feeling like a team everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people 

i hope this addresses your issue

name j block was just a gas contract at name risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of pl or through a one off approval of a dash no risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries even though there is no capital a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved providing it doesnt fit into a book name
 

after reviewing the doorstep audit at long beach with the team i have the following conclusion

1 we should shut these offices down because we can not control them they dont make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at long beach

or

2 we establish a rigid template for how these offices operate my thought is that we create a mcdonalds hamburger type operation each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules hamburger quality is monitored from name routinely

there are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed

any thoughts name
 

name talked to whalley on this he said he is going to kill deal but needs to do it carefully so he doesnt demotivate people so i guess we should keep working on it but it most likely wont go anywhere a big concern name has now is that we have 7 billion of intl assets and the fear is that we lose people and no one will be around to monitor and operate these assets you need to use discretion on this but not waste too much time name

as mentioned in our floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams that we are forming to better address the business needs of name as it expands both in volume and scope supervisors of each rac sub group provided the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adjusted from time to time only the more senior people were included but others will be included as appropriate many will have to be multidimensional there will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is responsible for the activities of the team regardless of the rac group that you are in following are several thoughts concerning this process for consideration

	the purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework
	ancillary benefits include cross training of rac employees and heightened awareness of rac issues desiloization 
	all existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment
	successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude among the teams
	existing rac responsibilities remain in effect
 	teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues transactions will require more frequent informal meetings
	there are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio
	all team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction offer to help out if needed
	if formal crosstraining is necessary force it to happen
	encourage weak links in team to perform
	each quarter rac management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business unit with the team present this may take one quarter to implement
	if it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor
	individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the prc and compensation processes

the existing ees team has been quite successful and in large part was a catalyst to the recent reorganization there you can have an impact

this process should begin immediately 

thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort

i want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times lots of our efforts in the past building systems procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these feedback from both citibank and jpmchase and names board members has been very positive relative to rac congratulations to all

on another note i want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups especially more junior members of these groups because they come from rac they are not considered idle commentary and can be and have been damaging to morale to these people we all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior

thanks for contacting me about this
as a matter of fact i wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time

i think we should go ahead and adjust name to manager
effective march 1 the compensation would be her current base plus
10k this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager
such promotions take place in march and i think
name should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
ie my and names procrastination

 
on unrelated and more serious matter name hickerson is the primary client 
for names services he communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite names position he is in general unhappy with
her contribution this means that name will have to find another sponsor or leave name
given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge
name volunteered to pay a very generous severance to name from his budget

it sounds great i know from personal experience that its much better to develop
a new technology quietly and test it before everybody develops high expectations

is it ok to consult one my associates name lin and  ask him for his
opinion he knows infinitely more about transmission than i do

a quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group i understand the
new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location

my recommendation is against it if the objective of having two separate weather
groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views
the new seating arrangements will nullify it the power weather guys will 
defer to name who has unquestionable authority and experience

if we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups
under names leadership

please let me know what you think

a short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with prediction company

i projects in the order they suggested it

	1 prediction company develops a pl attribution system allocation of pl to different market
	factors like spreads volume traders skills etc traders performance evaluation system

	2 decision support system a model recommending transactions to a trader without
	full trade automation

	3 fully automated trading system setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform
 
ii financial arrangements combination of a number of different forms of equity participation direct payments 
   per project on completion and   fees per transaction

	1 equity investment would reduce fees and payments for prediction company this is a preferred form of 
	    names participation

	2 payment per project would look like consulting fees

	3 next to equity investment they would like to see a constant income stream through
	    fees charged per transaction my comment in case they design a decision support
	    tool it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee it will be difficult to identify
	    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system


recommendations

	1 a visit to santa fe with name name to discuss an equity investment

	2 i shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship
                with ubs

	3 we should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to name from
	    prediction company

he looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive
hundreds of such resumes the way to

to name

who has general quantitative skills but expects that
name will train him from ground zero in all other
disciplines we had recently a candidate who wrote a letter
and complained about being asked questions about
energy economics finance etc during an interview

i hope you feel better i have seen the message from name in which he confirmed
that he approached the research in name on his own he did not
receive any encouragement from me and from name i hope this closes this issue
 
i can understand names motivation but dont endorse the way he takes to reach his goals
he hopes to accomplish more in a larger group where he can have more interaction with his peers
who have similar backgrounds i think also that he developed an appreciation for good interpersonal 
relations in my group he could observe during his stay in name
 
my advice is to try to figure out how to use his skills for name and how to develop his social
intelligence

rakesh mentioned that there is an additional conditionality that will result
in an adjustment of our valuation of the restrictions imposed on the forwards going
into the raptor vehicles

we were not aware of this conditionality at the time the project 
we can however easily incorporate it in our valuation model
this omission makes our valuation more conservative
form the names point of view


please let us know if this is required

another interesting problem that may lead to a trip to an exotic place

as you know brazil is in the midst of a very severe power shortage about
95 of installed capacity in brazil is hydro out of about 65 gw and the level of
water in the reservoirs  is about 20 of the normal we have a huge
exposure in brazil given our ldc investments and merchant power plants

measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from brazil 
are asking for help we have looked into a similar problem in norway and came up with interesting
technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers objections these
objections may not apply to brazil

can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and remy collonge from
sao paulo to discuss the problem he will be  back in his office on tuesday 

i shall call you tomorrow about it what is your phone number

a few comments on the state of our var models the issues always become more
controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and i would
like to share with you a few observations

1 critical importance of a  good risk management system to
name and the pe ratio

a number of recent analysts reports characterized name as a hedge fund engaged in
massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors one way to counter this
crirticism is to emphasize the quality of names risk amnageemnt system and
our strong risk amangeemnt culture  our claims regarding the strong risk management
technology and culture should be however supported  by reality

it is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can
convince the external parties stock analysts creditors  credit rating agencies about
the quality of our financial technology this can be done 
through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology as we have done frequently in the past
by reality

2 inputs from the trading desks vs historical calibration

the var system used in name is based on the assumption that as much input
information as possible should come from the market ie trading desks or should be calibrated to
the market observations as opposed to historical data

one immediate improvement we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks
information and move if possible to replace them with market based forward looking data

one should not assume of course that the information coming from the
trading desks is perfect one problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect
between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices 
curves the forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized 
forward price volatioty if this is not the case back testing for some portfolios will 
systematically fail 

one way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically
fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements it will allow us to identify the 
source of problems we see in some books

3 var process management

given the size of our trading operation we are running a var factory
a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios
what is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality
of the results

specifically i am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility
for the model calibration right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization
and resides somewhere between the it rac and research as a result we have
inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls some inputs used 
currently in the system are 2 years old

another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects in my view 
some recent modification to the system tied up it resources and were of marginal
usefulness and in some case on questionable
understanding of mathematics of course i can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to
bring these issues to the table in a meeting involving all the concerned parties

and

i have informed ryan siurek cc name buy on oct 4
that i cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the ljm
transactions those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past

i have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information without doing  full due
diligence

feel free to provide the information to name but
please inform her i cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past i am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are in my view
mutually exclusive

do you want to go to learn what happened or do you want to go yell at those guyssee those guys get yelled at
 

are we proposing to pay refco for order flow like a tick per trade or are we going to give them our prices and then they widen them to add their juice
 

i really have no idea  probably lower just becasue of the trend and overwhelming bearish view of the market
 

the way i read it was the 30 something contract signed are good but ones under negotiation from there are either being renegotiated or talks terminated
 

expected value of game  12  0  14  1  18 2  116 4 132  8
			     0      	25 	25	25	25 	
			     infinity
 

the reason i asked is this sounds bad but right now the cheaper you are the easier time ill have finding you a job
 

everybody and their mom is short plus a lot of people think the zf is too wide so either the front needs to go up or the back down

nope

maybe we just hold all the gas until next winter  well worry about that problem next september  
novy expiry can go anywhere  too early to say   probably around 2 though as i cant imagine who is a baseload buyer of gas in november when the us is a net injector the first 12 weeks barring cold spell and the pipelines are trying to start withdrawing
 

did not but i went to my wine locker and picked out 12 bottles for the weekend so i think were okay unless youre taking some to your friends  ill call you when im ready and well figure it out

deutsche bank asked me to ask you to call their maintenance margin person name jones at 212 469 6773  i think they are trying to margin us  
name
 

in regards to the stock tell me about it  
flat price me thinks we go nowhere for a while think the next push down doesnt come again until late october  im buying z 300250 put spread for 11  still looking for 31 by end of season  probably 29530 for nov 31  who wants baseload gas for dec in that scenario
agas think high 70s is neutral the market  if it comes out 7085 you can shit on vol  thatd be good for me
 

i actually went to go talk to him yesterday but he was already gone and hes on vacation today  ill talk to him next week  probably better for him to hear the benfits from my mouth  we do need to talk to him before we get too far  
 
eol working very well as of late
 

we have the whole curve out  the nymex is just another trading platform that is inconsequential to markets we make except for arb opportunities and for the fact that our swaps settle against the nymex settlement  our volume is pretty normal at this point
 

me thinks the currency market has seen enough failed interventions that it shrugs off any intervention and may view it as a sign of weakness  me also thinks that until foreigners quit plowing all their money into the us the dollar should remain fairly strong  however if all the hedge funds are short which i assume they would be the turnaround will be very quick

i want to have a group mtg from 400500 today to discuss some of the enron issues and then vol if we have a chance
 

with the daily chaos that ensues on this floor sometimes communication is sacrificed  fortunately we have the message board to facilitate real time sharing of information  i think all of us including myself underutilize this tool  i want to encourage everybody to keep the board open on their computers all day long  in addition i want everybody to post at least one message every day  this can be an interesting trade that just happened what counterparties are trying to do new information you uncovered etc  information we learn can be very valuable to other desks and it is only fair that if were taking info from the board we should be contributing as well
 

ive been selling  was long 500 and selling out  everybody will  be expecting the crude draws  they dont matter  think this is tremendously bearish all energy demand  supply shocks are the only question but i dont think us will end up fighting a war against the middle east  who cares if we nuke afghanistan
 

scary how we have the same sense of humor  havent told anybody yet  so i have a favor to ask whether we never talk again just become good friends or grow old together with 6 kids please neverever refer to me as the energy guy  you can refer to him as that just not me  
officially tired of watching the news  actually there is very little new about it  channel 12 the local viewpoint  cnn the national viewpoint  cnbc  the business viewpoint  espn the sports viewpoint  name robertson channel gods viewpoint  the politicians all hold news conferences and talk for 15 minutes and say nothing  we interrupt the state depts news conference to bring you the justice depts news conference where we expect there going to say no comment at this time frequently  i have a tv on my desk at work that is on constantly just in case something happens but meanwhile its driving me nuts
just found out another girl i knew is missing i was supposed to go out with this girl a couple years ago on a blind date but it never went through  i met her after that  
so lets talk about something better  well start shallow  what kind of music do you like

your guys are probably seeing this as well but 50 cents higher our customer biz was 955 from buy side  now its 5050  can almost smell blood among the producers  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see straight  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now id be looking for a 25 cent move up  just cant see that happening at this level though

rules to a game
you flip a coin if you get tails you win 0  if you get heads i give you 1  keep flipping until you get a tails at which point you walk away with the money  however each heads you get after the first you double your money  so if you flip heads 3 times and then tails you get 4  whats you bidoffer on playing this game  would you pay 5 to play 1 2  what you charge me play against you
 

i felt fine  i ate a breakfast bar before i went  normally dont do that  wont be doing that again

wanna do something tonight  what time do you get out of here
 

what do they mean when they have a cold summer scenario results in a 150 price  these guys are freaks
 

think trade reluctant to sell here until they see aga on wednesday and knowing that tropical activity will develop at some point  however think the failure from 335 last thursday will weigh on people  think that nobody wants to own above 325 only as very short term trade to sell to someone else 510 cents higher unless aga is very bullish

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyones psychological 4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short  next sellers need to be from producer community  saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the ep community  short covering rallies will get more common here  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good except maybe in bid week  my concern is if we go to 4 and people want to cover some shorts whos selling it to them  might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break 5
 

ina
were going to have a mandatory eol trading simulation session today at 400  can you email all traders on the floor and make sure the desk heads know  also postpone my 400500 mtgs until after 5 or tomorrow

thanks
 

i just cant get too enthused about the short side  why did cash go out trading 5 for a weekend when there was zero power gen demand  the easy answer is that pipes were short and everybody playing catchup from this week  fine  whats it going to trade next week  the gas daily swap implies flat but its lagged the actual spread all month  i think cash surprises by trading positive next week with no power gen  this market is not trading like we run out of injection space  so either the market is wrong maybe but a dangerous assumption to make or i dont see why sep is so overvalued relative to the rest of the curve  you can certainly argue that the winter and cal 2 are too high but those certainly dont seem to be going down very fast  march is off 8 cents since jun 29  so if the market wants to say that march is worth 354 then why is sep too high at 298
 

my old carrier went out of biz this week convenient huh  so i do not have service as of 2 days ago
 

its going to take complete rejection of phys molecules to get solidly under 3  i expect some really good chop for 2 weeks  have enough people waiting for sub 3 to buy back all their shortsdont think its that easy from here
 

i had to cover some  too much risk  rode most of it back down  i think this whole event is bearish energy
 

name
to explain the pl of 349000   
we executed the trade when you gave the order the delta anyway first thing in the morning  the market rallied 8 cents from the morning with the back rallying about 25 cents  on 904 pv contracts curve shift was 226000  the balance 123000  is almost exactly 01 bidmid which i think is pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and vol  cal 3 straddles for instance are 139  145

looking out for you bubbeh

name
here is my analysis of my guys
name maggi 2  pl for first half a bit misleading  up till today he has run and taken the pl for 7 days  3 days were in the first half of the year and 4 in july so far  running eol is a law of averagessome days you get killed some you do well  the second day he got massacred t boone sold 3000 contracts as well as the floor selling on an illiquid day followed by gap down the next day  pl for that day was 7  the four days in july have been really good probably 67  so i look at his pl for the first half of the year as jan 1jul 6  that pl of 15 is around my expectations  runs low var  pretty good at running eol when im not there  a little too reactionary but hopefully more experience will help  makes most money in market making probably slighlty negative in greeks and negative in curve shift  would like for him to turn both of those positive  a bit hadicapped because present format doesnt allow him to fully get physical info  required to spend all time in front of computer  needs to develop name griffith to allow him to get off the desk more  good contrarian trader  often has opposite position of floor  willing to stop out and is nimble  needs to take more of a macro view of vol rather than ending up with everybody elses positions  vital for me to have him as a bbackup right now  cannot function without one of us on the desk 
computer causing problems  will email with other guys later
 

sorrysorrysorry

	youre not still pulling that leg thing are you  we dont work out again until wednesday
 

just following up to see if the recruiting season has started and to make sure everything is going okay  if you need anything just say the word
 

hey
1  theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ice after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote  this is a prearranged trade and is illegal on nymex but it is my understanding it will be legal on ice assuming ice uses the ipe clearing platform where prearranged trading is legal   agree about liquidity  i dont think this really helps ices volumes nor liquidity  funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ice in the current state  
2  my guess is not intercommodity but maybe intracommodity  for instance a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive  

important note ice is our competition and i am veryvery wary to support their system unless absolutely necessary

things are okay  may be much better in a week or two  can you email me an update of how the 3 hedge funds are doing  i may have another chunk of money to invest should you have any good opportunities lying around  still mainly interested in alternative investments with you  also can you confirm my address  i have moved recently and dont know if you have the new one  2000 bagby 15403 name 77002
 

of course  info here goes nowhere weve had trouble discerning where the switching takes place because the economics get very blurry credits ldc costs transport taxes restrictions on  hours plants can burn resis are hard to account for and are different for everybody   also some noneconomic factors convenience inertia multimonth fuel purchases hedges accounting procedures resid in storage already  its a big blur in my mind  i look at general levels and for anecdotal evidence  have seen zero anecdotal evidence so far  will also watch agas for the indication  but so will everybody else
 

exaggerationsword travels everywhere doesnt it  howd you hear

me thinks everybody short and everybody wants the market to go down  im relatively flat and would love to squeeze all the fuckers out so i can sell them 20 cents higher
 

1 i would guess notional value 23 bil per day including financial derivatives
2 probably doubled market share in gas since eol

happy bday by the way  name everythings going well

were having network problems again so i hope you get this soon
 

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyones
psychological 4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short  next sellers need to be from producer community  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the ep community  short covering rallies will
get more common here  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good except maybe in bid week  my concern is if we go to 4 and people
want to cover some shorts whos selling it to them  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break 5
 

i assume youre going to let people select news categories such as us energy news and avoid articles about paskistani oil fields
 

just wanted to thank you for the gift basket  i usually dont like them because they have crappy wine but that was actually a really good bottle  sat out on my patio last night drinkning wine and eating cheese and fruit  thanks
 

any interest in going to bb game tonight  crude reunion  jt racecar and me  tix in hr 70 catching territory
 

cost about 200000300000

	our internal estimates were in the 102106 range so no  i think pira overestimating the gas gen burn for the week  problem is there is no real good burn for at least two weeks going forward  weve dropped 15 in a couple months and havent picked up an mmbtu of demand  thats a big problem
 

my email as far as i know is jarnoldenroncom  not on msn though
i made space for your 8 people as well as ferries roberts and the other person  you requested  come down tomorrow and ill show you the layout again
john
 

im big seller of interventions  they tend not to work  if the gas market wants to go lower enron coming out and buying 10000 contracts is not going to stop the market from going down  maybe in the short term but thats it  same with currencies  ecb can come out and transfer some of its foreign reserves from dollars to euros but they are limited by their currency reserves unless they want to act in the futures market at which point they have to exit that position at some point  i think it is more psychological than anything  i think overall market interventions have been extremely ineffective
 

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here  still dont think this is equilibrium  need to see aga coming in lower than expectations for a couple weeks signaling that weve moved down the demand curve  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get close to the psychological 400 target  market needs producer selling to get us through there  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett  hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently  still going lower but it will be a tougher move from here
 

ng lows in place but q1 forecast 22    
dont understand
also whats longer term forecast ie past mar 03
 

biggest question in my mind is we assume resid is a fixed target or if resid needs to keep market share and as natty drops so does resid to maintain its market
 

prompt month vol is moving from 60 to 40 cob todayshould increase capacity for front month by 50 for anybody who wants them
 

for what its worth i liked your answer to the california attorney general comment in the journal  what a freak that guy is
 

i dont have a problem with that  the 3 factors i ask in releasing info are

	1 do customers even know the info is available or useful
	2 is the info publicly available
	3 is the info easily obtainable

	in this case the answer is yes to all three so i dont care  if the answer is no to one or more of the above a judgment call has to be made
 

tell them that margin will be posted as normal no excess nor any intraday calls  since ene is flush with liquidity he should be very comfortable that we can pay our bills  the positions will roll off through time until the position gets very small and then we will xpit everything out of man and close the account  anything different and all dealings between man and name in energy will be terminated in both otc and futures
 

if cashfutures is 1015 then oct will have a very weak settle

they are trying to use the regular access system on the internet which was supposed to come out two weeks ago but they delayed because the firewalls and security issues hadnt been solved
 

had phone problems lost my charger  it was good  i may be the most influential in the world of finance in the past 50 years
 

bbb credits dont go bankrupt overnight  we can get downgraded overnight though  put a clause in the contract that if we get downgraded below inv grade there is some sort of orderly liquidation of the swaps  talk to credit about how we handle this with others
 

there are few scenarios whereby that spread comes in except if you take it to settlement  if dec is strong jan is strong too  if dec is weak jan retains some risk premium
 

hey
thats one hell of a bd celebration  namet think i can hang in you guys  
was definitely a little sleepy yesterday  went to the bb game and then had a biz dinner last night  i was almost asleep driving home at 830  at least i was sane enough to yell buy and sell at random points during the day
 

ps  can you bring me some free samples of the bladder control medicine  itll save me some money
 

depends on the legal outcome  thhere is still a possibility we get all of our money back although a roe of 0 for 10 years  still a better roe than broadband investments
 

1   dont know  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent  some will not come back at the same prices it went off  residential conservation i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back as prices fall  as far as switching i dont think 2 is the floor some people think it is  maybe 6 is the floor
2  you know my outlook for xh  with slightly above normal weather jan goes out at 275 and that is not constrained by a 6 floor  next jv too far away to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a 250350 commodity  
3 the obvious
4 yes  believe if we end at 26 in the ground the current nymex forward curve may be fairly priced  my belief is that at the current prices we will end up with much more than 26 and that 5 is not value if we have 28 in the ground and gaining y on y  circular argument that leads to my belief that prices must fall
5  not necessarily  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact that there will be much less demand destruction  probably
 

savita
im going to need an additional report daily for the next couple weeks for the top 50 counterparties a summary of total eol volumes and phys gas volumes for average of rolling 30 days average of rolling 5 days and previous day with volume differentials in percent relative to 30 day average  for instance 


total volumes	
		previous day		5 day			30 day
aquilla		240  	20		330	10		300
el paso		275 	10		200	20		250


us gas phys fwd firm  1 month

				buy							sell

please advise how quickly you can put this together

understand  name has been mans biggest account for years and during that time we have paid them a lot in commissions  they approached us on wednesday to try to increase the margin required even though we were below the credit threshold that had been established in the contracts written 5 years ago  i refused to agree to change the margin calculations  it became clear that man was uncomfortable with the exposure to such a big account given that man is a relatively small shop  i agreed to xpit some positions such that they would get more comfortable with the outstanding risk in the account  at the same time i told them i was transacting business as usual and if they couldnt handledidnt want the clearing business i would clear somebody else but that was a permanent decision for them to make  clear our business always or clear it never  paribas has stuck with us throughout and i intend to clear the majority of future biz with paribas  i agreed during hours of phone calls wednesday that we would xpit specific futures positions on thursday which we did but the rest of the position would stay there  they agreed  we specifically stated the rest of the positions and the options would stay and we would work out those positions over time   them if they are trying to go back on that
 

sounds good  i have cash  i work at the old name building  just give me a call when youre close and ill meet you on the street right in front of the building

any thoughts about next weekend  i still want to go somewhere  this is killing me  how about south america or is it too far


i made it back to name last night  incredible security at the airport in london  it was a mob scene  in addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carryons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate  i saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage  i couldnt really hear what it was all about  we were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer  the brits were all very nice of course while i was in london but it sure is good to be home
 

you can confirm that it is not regulated and send a copy of cert of incorp which deb korkmas should have if name doesnt
 

better check with stacy to make sure they are done with this one
 

i will not be able to attend
 

sounds good to me
 

the first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to gas daily

i have trouble with the second one  this really looks like a basis swap so i think we need to start with basis swap language  can you call me on this one
 

can you add yourself to my rolodex
 

is it possible to restrict delete ability  we need to have a lot of people with write access but they dont all need to be able to delete entire records
 

thanks for the offer but i cant get away that early without taking vacation time  at this point my flight gets in at 836 pm

im afraid names friends will be disappointed  the twostep a polka or maybe a cw line dance is more in the texas line theyd be disappointed there as well but their expectations might be slightly more reasonable
 

our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger  such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between name affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of thirdparty agreements  a merger by ena or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ena might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex
 

while this statement makes reference to energy it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions  i dont know if we have affected transactions or not  if so you may care about this  my impression is that the name commodities traders will be signing off on this possibly with minor comments as early as this morning  if you guys want to make comments maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach please let name shackleton or name gray know as soon as possible
 

i called the moorings about a miami charter over new years and they said they are shutting down the entire location as of 1130  when i asked about any other locations that might still have boats left she said they have a one week minimum for all charters at that time  sorry

swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons the most common being no upfront transaction cost 
swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another  from floating price to fixed or vice versa they are used most often to fix or lock in prices and margins between prices in exchange for price protection the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed
the typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index settlement is financial  ie cash changes hands physical product does not each month during the life of the transaction the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party

swap producer example 

ammoniaking a producer of ammonia is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months the company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan to eliminate this threat ammoniaking enters into a swap with name that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at 100ton on 300000 tons of ammonia or 75 percent of monthly production this margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target
chart 1

during the life of the swap

        ammoniaking continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice at floating market prices
        on a monthly basis ammoniaking and name exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of 100ton and the prevailing floating price spread
        for example if the floating spread is 95ton in a given month ammoniaking will receive 5ton in a given month on 300000 tons however if the floating spread is 105ton ammoniaking will owe 5ton to name
        ammoniaking has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target

swap enduser example 

fertpro a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammoniabased products the companys customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices this makes it impossible for fertpro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude on the other hand customers dont necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall they simply want a listed price they can count on to service its customers while protecting its margins fertpro enters into a oneyear price swap the swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at 100ton on a monthly volume of 10000 tons or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales
chart 2

during the life of the swap

        fertpro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices
        on a monthly basis fertpro and name exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of 100ton and the floating price for ammonia
        for example if the floating price for ammonia is 105 in a given month fertpro will receive 5ton on 10000 tons however if the floating price is 95ton fertpro will owe 5ton to name
        the net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of 100ton
        the swap enables fertpro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices

caps  floors

like swaps caps and floors provide price protection but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements they are commonly thought of as price insurance ie for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level a price cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices floors are the opposite of caps they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential
with a cap or floor the full cost of the protection is predefined  it is equal to the premium paid for the cap or floor there are no potential future costs related to price movements
spread 7

cap enduser example

cropfood a manufacturer of urea wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases but is expected to pass on decreases without delay
to distinguish itself from competitors cropfood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months cropfood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go and to sweeten the deal cropfood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced no questions asked
the prospect likes cropfoods straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1000 tons of urea per month in order to honor its pricing promise without putting the companys margins at risk to rising prices cropfood purchases a oneyear price cap on ammonia at 120ton for 12000 tons per month the cost of the cap is 2ton
chart 3

during the life of the cap agreement

        cropfood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices
        name receives a 2ton premium from cropfood for the 120ton price cap
        if the market price for ammonia goes above 120ton in a given month name will pay the difference to cropfood if prices are less than 120ton cropfood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock
        the effective cost of ammonia paid by cropfood is the floating market price up to a maximum of 120ton plus the 2ton premium paid for the cap
        cropfood has for a known cost of 2ton captured new business by meeting the customers price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process

floor producer example

ammoniaking a producer of ammonia anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months the company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the twomonth period the plant is taken offline there is concern that prices could soften over the twomonth turnaround period squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time
to protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period ammoniaking buys a twomonth ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time the floor price is set at 145 and costs 3ton the total premium payable by ammoniaking is 150000 50000 tons multiplied by 3ton
chart 4
 

each month during the life of the price floor

        ammoniaking sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market floating prices
        name receives a 3ton premium from ammoniaking for the 145ton price floor
        if the floating price for ammonia is greater than the 145ton floor price there is no action under the floor contract the effective price received by ammoniaking for its ammonia is the floating market price less the 3ton premium
        if the floating price goes below the 145ton floor price to 140ton for example ammoniaking will receive the 5ton difference from name in this instance ammoniaking effective price for ammonia is 142ton  the 145ton floor price less the 3ton premium
        in summary the price floor has established a minimum price of 145ton with full upside potential at a known cost of 3ton

example 1

party a calculates that it is in the money 100 which results in a loss to party a from the termination
party b calculates that it is out of the money 98 which results in a gain to party b from the termination
there are no unpaid amounts

the payment amount is 50 percent of 100  98  99
since the payment amount is positive party b the party with the net gain pays 99 to party a the party with the net loss



example 2

same as example 1 except party a owes 150 in unpaid amounts to party b and party b owes party a 12 in unpaid amounts

the payment amount is a 50 percent of 100  98 plus b 12 minus c 150  negative 39
since the payment amount is negative party a the party with the net loss pays 39 to party b the party with the net gain

thanks for that name  i am stranded here in london and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that i am an american and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said that we are under appreciated the world round that the name plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us could have resisted as we have using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world

are you guys working on this already
 

here is the revised review password  oberon  i have meetings scheduled for the afternoon and am not sure i will be able to get out of them at any particular time  does it make sense to give her the review without me being there and meet later or not
 

looks good to me  one remaining concern is that section d may not provide much protection  according to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the ferc in the past they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so  if we want that kind of protection it should be mandated not made possible by regulatory action  im not necessarily recommending a change i just dont want anyone to be taking any comfort from section d
 

i made it back to name last night  incredible security at the airport in london  it was a mob scene  in addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carryons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate  i saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage  i couldnt really hear what it was all about  we were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer  the brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home

i asked for a return date for you of september 12 which is the day im coming back  but since i will be going to name and you will be going to nyc we wont be traveling together anyway  would you rather stay an extra day or two

we discussed the process of doing away with the confirmations for enrononline transactions in our last group meeting  it looks like the most equitable way to staff these is to rotate them among the lawyers like we rotate masters among the paralegals  no one should end up with more than two or three of them that way  name moore is taking a first cut using the form and adding the powerspecific provisions and then sending them on to the gas group  the gas group will then forward them to me for us to include any derivativesspecific provisions

under normal circumstances we would not need an name corp resolution and in fact the corporate secretary and treasury offices can handle moving the money around so we do not propose to do an name corp board action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary  the other resolutions we can get in place easily

i think notre dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed  does that mean we need to issue the golden share today
 

hopefully just a nuisance

rats  i thought i had picked a day when we were all going to be here  your day off was not listed on my group calendar  sorry
 

while i think the law actually works that way we have avoided putting it in writing so far  the way the web site works the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless  the time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they dont see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out  i guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer  the website doesnt provide a mechanism for that  if we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader in practice it might not be an issue

thanks for your note  ive been thinking about you guys a lot too  i havent been back to nyc since i left on the qe2 on 94  every time i heard about the conditions downtown i assumed you would be living in the country  sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel  i know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly  also sorry to hear about mrs b  i hope she is doing better

it has been chaotic and very depressing here  not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place  in fact when they finally announced it my primary feeling was one of relief  things had gotten very bad  next time we get together i can fill you in on all the details  at least for now i am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances

its nice you have key west to get away to  youll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances i doubt that i could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease  it would be nice to get away from here now and then though  i was supposed to go to ft lauderdale did you know name was living there now a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there  that trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here  i had hoped to be in new york today for a seminar where i was actually scheduled to speak but cancelled that also  with luck things will start to get back to normal here soon  im really feeling the need for a break and 4 days in cincinnati next week dont count so maybe i can come visit some time in the next couple of months

tell name i said hi

name
 

thanks for your note  i am stranded in london and wont be able to get back until they start international flights again and i can get a seat  looks like that means sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me too on friday night
 

sorry about that  i have been a bit preoccupied  i put them in the car so i would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so i could stop at the post office  it turns out the neighborhood office is closed on saturdays and of course they were all closed on monday  you should have them tomorrow
 

sorry for the delay  i will be out of town most of this week but could set up a time to talk on the phone if that works for you either thursday afternoon or friday morning  otherwise how about monday august 6 at 1000 200 or 300
 

i think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for  just be very careful to try and minimize expenses
 

name  would you please revise names group list to delete name a taylor and add me as name e taylor  thanks

i am stranded in london  there are worse places these days  but hope to get back tomorrow sunday  glad you are well
 

thanks for the idea  i may need it sooner than i expected  its nice to know there are jobs out there but i think i can hold out until i find one somewhere better than boise  if you thought nobody wanted to visit name
 

my flight doesnt get in until 1030 or so on friday night  not sure what we can still do for food at that hour  do people eat late in ft lauderdale  in case youre still looking for food ideas i found these that looked interesting

isdas interview is on wednesday afternoon
 

kelly

thanks for getting back to me with your analysis  heres what ive done

not sure what the situation is with the lead expediter 95 position  the phone line of the manager for that one doesnt seem to be working and an email to him was returned as undeliverable  even though his name was in the company email address book  but hes in the same department as one of the jobs below sr purchasing agent i think and this position is a more junior slot so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway

the senior project manager 8090 and senior purchasing agent 80 slots are still open  i talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration  i have no feel for the timing on the proj mgr position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque but the guy on the purch agent job said the timing was great since hes taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review

ive left voicemail messages concerning the construction engineer 90 and processmechanical engineer ii 80 positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking

 on the others it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website  particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly  theres no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume

ill keep you posted on the others  if there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week you might want to submit for those on the website too  at least then you know your resume is in the hopper

name
 

both of you are listed in lotus notes on this one  not sure who has had most recent contact  i someone working on a noconfirms agreement for chase already
 

our agreements with nameonline customers prohibit us from sharing their names with third parties ie nonname companies  we can use our customer lists ourselves for marketing our products but can not give the lists to anyone else
 

here are the documents we discussed
 

i hope you can all join us for happy hour tomorrow from 600 at names wine bar  names is located at 2516 times blvd in rice village
 

lets get together with name and name to discuss how we should move forward with the forms
 

thats what he goes by
 

i have tentatively booked us on the qe2 sailing from southampton at 5pm on august 29 arriving new york at 730am on september 4  you and name have a caronia class cabin at 204532 per person including air from new york to london with a business class upgrade on continental  i have a single in the same class so we eat in the same restaurant  my plan would be to fly over on sunday evening  the 26th  since i have to be in ohio that morning  with that in mind i have also booked jr suites for us at 41 the allinclusive london hotel near buckingham palace that ive mentioned to you before  they are at 275 gbp per night 2 nights  of course if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in london i am sure that would be possible

the difficulty is that name has indicated an interest in staying in europe longer  certainly understandable  her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving ny on september 5 arriving in southampton sept 10 and then stay in europe for a few weeks  that doesnt work quite as well for me because i only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing i get one less day in london  ie we get off the boat on monday morning and i have to fly back tuesday morning  on the other hand we wouldnt be jet lagged on arrival in london

they will hold the reservation until tomorrow  whats your preference
 

can you please give me a call to discuss travel plans  i need to make some reservations today if at all possible

thanks  i have it  do you remember how im supposed to check for messages on it
 

a couple of other ideas of things we might ask for in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters

1  how many who have responded to this  shouldnt we have the opportunity to clear the conflict
2  commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side ie no nonames advice on these issues
 

i got your note and relayed it to name  our prayers are with you
 

just wanted to let you know that it doesnt look like ill be able to make it to ny this weekend as previously planned  ill let you know if that changes

name
 

your reservations went through on the card you wanted  i asked for 912 as your return date and 926 as names
 

yet another idea

a flashlight that has a magnet on the side or some kind of clamp to keep in the trunk of the car

this one might be good for name too
 

well deserved  its been fun watching the company recognize what we in legal have known all along
 

here is the aquilla nomoreconfirms agreement
 

names been working too hard  she meant financial masters
 

i was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by email all of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well  there are a very few which are not confirmed at all but i dont know of any that involve email
 

i understand that you will have an amel at the ft lauderdale boat show next month  do i need an appointment to see the boat
 

here is the revised performance evaluation for name
 

i ma leaving for the evening but was hoping we might get together for a bit tomorrow some time to go over where things stand on swapco and what needs to be done  can you leave a voice mail for me on 7138537459 letting me know what your schedule is like for tomorrow and when would work best for you
 

i already have a meeting scheduled at 11 on monday
 

i was looking through my emails for these and couldnt find them  have you guys already started these  i may have misplaced them  please coordinate with name since i will be out next week

thanks

name
 

im surprised that under the circumstances american wont just do it  name and i both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline continental for me and virgin for name  of course in our cases the original flights were cancelled  i dont have the cunard reservations number here and havent been able to access the web site this afternoon  i will get it for you when i get home  the fax number for the guest relations department is 3054633030

in a sense i felt safer in london than here  once we got off the qe2 we werent doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and i dont anticipate attacks against individual americans overseas  at least not outside of muslim countries  while there was an increase in police presence around town we didnt hear of any actual threats to americans while we were in london  airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further  the europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do  the sword rattling doesnt bother me too much  ive been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as youre in a friendly country it shouldnt be an issue  on the other hand it really feels good to be home and i can sure understand your wanting to have her with you

from her point of view i think that while the brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive the tragedy just isnt as immediate there and so the impact on name has been somewhat less than if we had been home  given that i think she doesnt want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in europe while she has the chance and is already over there  for me i have to say it was hard to have any fun after tuesday noon although i tried to put a good face on it  i dont know when that will improve since im still pretty depressed  its probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than i am  the lawyer in me sees two sides a a trip to paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and b why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you arent going to have a good time no matter where you go

feel free to give me a call if you want to chat

good luck

i havent had any complaints from the post office  in fact we used to have a mailbox outside the gate  it was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement it was stolen box post cement and all about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key their key does not fit any of the doors mine or yours was the best answer  when i gave him the key he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route  has there been a problem

on the electrician i am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician  so nothing has happened yet  ill keep you posted

thanks for your note  just so you have the whole picture  our analysis from a us law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades  the offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade  we have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade  this is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part  this happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed name can get you a copy if you want it  but when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake  under us law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed  in that case the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind  one alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customers completed transactions section as if it had never happened  as far as i know we have only had to do this once or twice
 

i think there is a real possibility here  it would be extremely challenging commercially

how do we convince customers to participate
two distinct areas  i existing portfolio of business and ii new business

new business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money who would say no to a aaa credit  still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present separating them out as not netting with new trades

existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money  they will want the improved credit  but how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate  this seem to me to be the biggest hurdle


issues

requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts
	adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate
	might make more sense where no current positions exist
	
contract hurdles

	need to allow for termination by defaulting party so name vmac will be able to control termination on default
	need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to vmac
	may require changing permitted credit support from counterparties letters of credit probably dont work

if we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure an initial chunk of money will have to be given to vmac to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio  how much is it and do we have that money

its not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties  that is if we have given an aggregate 200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate 100 million credit line to in the money counterparties will vmac be satisfied with the mismatch  name we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers  if we go to 100 collateral requirements for all participating transactions this is solved since there cant be a mismatch  name customers agree to 100 collateral requirements  ie no credit lines

once the supportedparticipating portfolio is out of the money name will have to post collateral to vmac  if we fail vmac can default all participatingsupported contracts  

when all of the contracts are terminated with name as the defaulting party the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market  presumably vmac will require some cushion to cover this

i just saw the reference to the gala in the oct dw mini calendar  congrats  im already looking forward to it

ps  if youre around this weekend it looks like great sailing weather
 

i marked my comments on the document and left it in your office
 

would there be any interest in using the auction functions on eol for this product instead of a product line  there is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules  reserve prices or not sale commitment or not timing etc  and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them   i assume we are only showing one side of this market

thanks for your message  is there a number where i can call you
 

do you have time to look at this
 

i can get the netco document signed but dont know anything about cgnn  who should i give that to
 

i honestly have never heard of either of those companies so dont know how to get them signed  i expect these are part of other efforts where i am not on the need to know list  if you know another name lawyer involved in those efforts i suggest you try them
 

i dont see why not
 

i have tickets to the astros game on friday tomorrow eve  any interest
 

if you havent heard back in an hour or so you may have to print it out and go down and shove it under their noses  name can show you where they sit if you dont already know

san name oct 18 2001 forestweb  weyerhaeuser co will increase the us price of its northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk price by 20tonne to 500tonne effective nov 1 according to a buyer source another buyer source said weyerhaeuser has increased his price by 20tonne on the sawdust pulp that he buys and i assume on the others weyerhaeuser officials were not available for comment weyerhaeuser has been the lone holdout at the us price of 480tonne for oct 1 when other north american producers went to 500tonne the competitors have complained that weyerhaeusers price was a drag on their efforts producers and buyers alike have said that 500tonne has been a hard sell in october partly because of the market but also because demand has been so slow a number of sources say nbsk is at 480tonne for october though a few are paying the 500tonne price i dont think we will pay 500 in november a buyer said today i think it will be 490 an agent today described the weyerhaeuser news as a plus but added now all we need is for demand to pick up another agent also responded cautiously there is no indication anywhere in the world where demand has picked up certainly not in the paper business without that producers can announce what they want to but it is not a slam dunk he said as for october transaction  aid that in most cases they didnt move i know everyone needs price increases and i know the inventories have gone down but my feeling is they will go up again he said noting typical latefall patterns  said that in contrast to the past paper companies have not been able to make money off of low prices its going to be a battle for sure he said theres a lot of fighting going on a lot of buyers are saying theyre not going to pay it

i am meeting with name name this wednesday to start working on price forecast

i am currently working with name on inventory forecast and the procedure is as follows

based on the formula capacity  op rate  shipments  forecast inventory

we used pppc capacity forecast for the year and divided by 12 to get the monthly forecast then multiply this with our own estimate of the operating rate which can be an average of the last 2 months or the operating rate of last month carried forward or the last months operating rate difference with the average and apply that difference to calculate the next  month op rate 

we also estimate the level of shipments as the last 3 years average for the month we are trying to forecast

so far we have only tested september and the forecast was pretty close to the actual


let me know if this is what you requested

as a followup to our conversation last week i have tried to get the list of mills from pppc but they are not responding to my requests there is another way to compile that by using jacobs sirrine database information

second i changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest norscan inventory number that i got from pppc and so the forecast for october changed a bit more in line with the historical average now

let me know what you want to do on the pulp millss list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet

name

you could probably add expected capacity projections to see how asian capacity will change in the future both in pulp and paper and compare that to lets say other areas of the world i remember that in the risi conference the speakers were saying that asian pulp capacity increase will lag behind that of latin america but their paper capacity will probably explode so they will major pulp buyers

anyways you can find the capacity expansion data in the pppc website let me know because i have some printed copies too

name concerning the environmental liabilities which may impact transwestern if name should direct the liquids from their 8 line into the pipeline liquids tank at wt1 i have a concern  

the liquids that are generated in the 8 line are exempt from hazardous waste regulations rcra as long as they stay in the name line and are not transfered and collect in a mainline tank  because wt1 is a mainline compressor station any chemicals or compounds which are regulated under subtitle c of rcra  become the responsibility of the owner of the mainline tank  within the past few years we have experienced the collection of regulated liquids at wt1 which were not placed there by tranwestern  chemicals which producers and processing upstream of wt1 have placed downhole to enhance gas production and other agents such as corrosion inhibitors and pipeline solvents have found their way into our tank and we have paid for the disposal  unfortunately there is no way to segregate the bad materials from the good recycleable materials

based upon this i would recommend that we not allow dukes pipeline liquids to collect into our tank

randy i tried to send you a note about a week ago about my elk hunt but it came back undelivered  i thought you might have changed your address  guess i typed it in by mistake age does that to you sometimes  yes things are stressful but as you eluded to god doesnt give his kids a spirit of fear but confidence that he is in control  i never thought i d see the name empire tumble but when you torture and strangle a corporation hard enough and long enough eventually it gives up and surrenders  there is a push underway to isolate the pipelines from the name umbrella and make all business units with money making assets separate from the rest of name  transwestern is definately a money making asset and that is what may keep me afloat  well see  anyway as long as i keep my focus on name and keep reminding myself of that which is important family and health i know ill come through all of this

sorry to hear that there is the word reorganization  in hess  this kind of stuff generally never does anything but upset employees and create a period of time when nobody is productive  i hate this kind of stuff i know that change is inevitable but so disruptive  ill keep you in prayer isnt it great to have the confidence and assurance that we serve a big enough god that he can handle all our problems  keep the faithmy friend and focus on the eternal  just like name wrote were just pilgrims in a foregin land waiting for the trip home and promise of names return

thanks i needed that
 

name i am sorry about your loss mostly because those in the family of god hate to see pain hit a family member  even under the most dire and seemingly impossible situations god is in control  its his promise that he will never leave us nor forsake us  that in itself is a real comfort and security knowing we have his eternal and loving spirit with us at all times  when you get some time read romans 828 and then meditate on it  so many times we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by him because he desires to conform us inito the image of his son sometimes he has to empty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that he can fill us with blessings that glorify him once we make a heart commitment and his spirit sets up residence within us gods promise in romans is to work everything including a job loss to his glory  if we are eternally minded and understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven then life on earth begins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very temporary  i will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation of gods work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto him in your name walk  i will keep my ears open for any employment opportunities

name as per your request presented below is a status of the air permitting activity by the agencies as of today 110101

stations 1 and 2 the epa has completed is review of these state permits and has sent them back to the adeq for comment  i have spoken to shudeish the permit engineer for the adeq and he is reviewing epas comments as this e mail is being written  he will give me a call when his review is complete but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to the public hearing  these permits went out for public notice on october 15 and 16 which means that the comment period ends on nov 15 and 16  the adeq plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday nov 19 in name az at 700 pm  i plan on being there  name is located approx 30 miles west of flagstaff az  the address for the hearing is the council chambers located at 113 south 1st street  so far there have been no responses submitted to the adeq by the public  in epas review process they  had a problem with methodology proposed by transwestern for measuring sulfur in the fuel gas  we had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel monitoring schedule they wanted us to do wet chemistry  we convinced them otherwise name because of this you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer for the needles facility  this should save you about 40k  there was also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions from the turbine and catepillar  this has been resolved also

stations 3 and 4  i received a call from name kohn the permit engineer for the epa  he is satisified with the permit application contents and has also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations  there are no outstanding issues on these permits from the epa  the public comment period for the station 3 and 4 permits ends nov  3  after this date it will take 12 weeks for the regional administrator of the epa to sign off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to transwestern  as of this date there have been no comments submitted to the epa for the permits for station 3 and or 4

ill keep everyone apprised of future events

you should read this  you wont like some of the comparisons but it is a nice statement about what our team has accomplished
 

why not point out that we are always adjusting employment levels across our businesses  we have people leaving as we reorganize or reduce activities in certain areas and we have people moving to other areas or being hired into areas where we are starting new businesses or growing  we simply have not had the mass layoffs that other companies have announced
 

i like your revised version

i have placed a call to name  in case i dont reach him i put the attached letter together  what do you think
 

thanks name  i was writing angry so i wasnt sure how it would come off  i did have my wife take a look and she assures me i didnt go overboard
 

ive been thinking about this  due to limited battery life calling areas etc im not sure that a combination cellpager is the way to go  im thinking that blackberries may be worth looking into
 

i spoke with name glotfelty on friday  the message they are stressing is that ferc is injecting much needed certainty  i think we should add that to our message as well
 

just fyi  amabile did not present to name management as she was unavialable on the day of the meeting  some of her work was presented by her colleague and name advisory council member  pankaj ghemewat
 

this is great
name name and name we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization
 

ok if i forward this to name lemmons or does he already have it

i think 90 might be at the heart of the matter  if we kept the class size smaller we could be more selective pay more for the higher quality talent make more meaningful assignments and provide for a more active mentoring and development program

fyi  i am speaking at his texas conservative forum in name
 

i know name from when he worked for commissioner jesse knight at the california puc  its worth noting that knight was the lone dissenting voice on the california restructuring fiasco  i told name that we probably didnt have anything for him in government affairs at this time but that we could possibly help out by circulating his resume on the hill ferc and perhaps in the western states legislative and executive branches if we hear of anyone looking for his expertise on electric issues  i am not asking anyone to make extra efforts  but if you hear of someone looking please pass names resume along
 

name was assistant secy of us treasury while this legislation was being negotiated  let us know if we can help
 

privileged and confidential  request for legal advice
 
some further questions
 


are we required to have a formal severance plan  can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a casebycase basis perhaps with rule of thumb guidelines

if we are required to have such a plan should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies

my original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern  perhaps because our plans are complicated we have had occasions where an employee was told something what heshe was told was incorrect heshe changed position based on what heshe was told and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake  obviously the right answer is to get it right the first time but on those occasions where we made the mistake do we have the flexibility to fix it
 

redraft confirm

	late on october 25th we received information about a possible threat to the name center  we are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated  nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the name center still further  in addition todays big e cafe event has been cancelled

	once again if you observe suspicious behavior please call security at 36200
 

im meeting with jerry patterson today  he is running for texas land commissioner  name said yesterday that we have given him a significant amount of money and that name has made a personal contribution  eliz  please tell me what we have given  pac and corporate if any  name  could you tell me of names personal contribution
 

attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001  the hr organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population  a few highlights from this report

the employee base continues to grow though on a significantly slower pace than 2000
terminations voluntary and involuntary are up dramatically this year
our contribution loss a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving has gone up indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods  however those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations ebs the former eecc and hpl
let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data
 

thanks for your interest  we have asked name olson to take the lead on forming this group so i am forwarding your message
 

attached is a set of message points we developed with the finance group for use with our external audiences
 

looks fine to me but i would change the second sentence to refer to the council meeting twice per year as opposed to committee
 

i think this is fine  it lends itself to an outline format so i suggest converting to word and make it a onetwo page leave behind
 

thanks for the inquiry i appreciate the interest very much  but i am not interested in participating
 

hold on  name and i discussed it but it is not my call whether anyone other than ees bears those costs  for what its worth i agreed with name that to the extent name and name had reached agreement regarding among other things names use of the corporate aircraft for nonees purposes that it may not make sense to have ees bear those costs  but it was clear in my conversation with name that it was not my call to make
 

im not sure i would give a list of topics id hate to see what would come of the prc video  perhaps we should just suggest a general theme which would be consistent with the forwardlooking thrust of the conference  eg a challenge we currently face or will have to overcome to get where we want to go
 

name  the process description ie where brown could play a key role is discussed in the middle of the update document
 

welcome and thanks for contacting me  let me know if there is anything i can do to help  ill ask my assistant to get in touch in the next couple of weeks  maybe we could have lunch

also my wife is working with the name of the rice engineering school on a history of engineering at rice  if your wife would like to get to know the engineering community in name we may be able to help out
 

im not sure  a couple of theories  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction  second in the absence of government subsidies i think ethanol is uneconomic and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in washington its unlikely to get better soon
 
in other news  names mom called last night  francis is dying  he was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver  he has had a great life and is well into his nineties  he is mostly sleeping now and name will be getting a hospice nurse today  name seems fine this has been coming for a while but of course no one is ever ready  he has stayed himself to the end  when name was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen he told her  i dont think well be having sex today
 

name had suggested that we try to get schmalensee sp for the october meeting as a substitute for joskow  what do you think
 

name kaufman and i met earlier this week with gov geringer of wyoming  he is supportive of a single rto though it is not clear that he favors a ferc mandate  he will wlso be pulling together a small group of western govs to meet with name wood to discuss the negative impacts of fercs refund and rate cap proceedings on western power markets outside of california  he has asked us for two things which i believe name name l and name are working on

agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the govs meeting with wood
a white paper describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes

like most western govs geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened  geringer will also be participating in bingamins panel on or about oct 9
 

tracey prepared the attached to make sure we had the facts surrounding another related party the travel agency in the park  as youll see from the attached use of the agency is encouraged for sound business reasons but is not mandatory
 

i see my numbers are going up but still not high enough  alot of my people are outside of name  are they solicited anyway  when we are finished i would like to see a breakdown between my namebased and outside name numbers
 

i talked to name yesterday  i had also talked to name robertson  name was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent now majority senator  i told name we should wait a bit and he agreed

who else is going to run from the republican side  i think that we ultimately ought to support a republican in this race incumbency or no  but i want to make sure we back the right one
 

i talked to skilling yesterday and asked him if he would be interested in teaching at the jones school  i was very clear that i had not talked to you or anyone else about it yet  he said he would be interested  if you would like to talk to him ill give you his number
 

we have already submitted our budget for pr govt affairs facilities corp hr etc  does the process below affect my numbers please say no
 

at the end of this string is a letter reply to mr krugmans most recent column  as indicated below name lay our chairman president and ceo would be happy to put his name to the letter  that would be our preference  let me know if you need anything more
 

further to our conversation of the other day we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations

please see attached spreadsheet  as you will note energy companies are already heavily slanted to the republican party as are pharmaceuticals for the most part  the interesting one is the financial sector where contributions are more evenly split with one bank of america heavily slanted to the democrats  have a look and lets talk
 

good update  please put me on the distribution list for future installments
what about the net benefits test  name the rate agreement suffice  call to discuss
 

i think we should have a version which says that ken lay named    i dont know that the board actually does the electing i think name may just be making sure that they are ok with his decision  i will confirm
 

im sorry  i told mom name and name but not you francis died two weeks ago  name is fine  she is taking care of things and when she gets done will be coming to see us around christmas
 

looks good  in the memo i wouldnt have ken refer to name powers as name  sounds too chummy in light of what he is doing
 

see below  these numbers were gathered in the first week of august during the time that the hypocrisy of name power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal  the reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him
 

i think you are the right person to get this  if not please let me know as soon as possible  see reply to krugmans august 17 column at the end of this email string  name lay names chairman and ceo is putting his name to the letter and we would prefer that you publish it as such
 

we can always reconsider in the sense of providing support to someone else but the money to brown is out the door
i would still like to see the data
 

thank you so much for your message  and thanks for sharing that particular memory  it means alot to me  i have always enjoyed working with you  you have always been so quietly competent and thorough  it made me smile just to see you  you are an important part of my name  i take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience but most importantly i take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you  all the best
 

this is an article that name stelzer wrote abut name  he is willing to talk further  his number is 2027773000  he said he would like to have me on the phone when you call
 

attached are two versions of a press release  we plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow  the second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility i need someone to confirm or deny  the first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts  please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and name denne karendenneenroncom  i understand that name mcmahon and name lee will discuss the attached at 700 cst tomorrow
 

thanks so much it was a tough week but i am very proud of how the whole team handled it  name name and i worked on the attached and i agree with your assessment but ir was not pleased  hopefully we can all move on now and get back to the work at hand  as much as i enjoyed working with name and looked up to him for his intellectual leadership i feel like the whole place is energized by names obvious competence calm and heart  i have never felt better about working here
 

name worked for ees before and came to us highly recommended  also know that i wont be talking to name until next week
 

thanks so much  as the week wears on we may need to contact our distinguished friends in the academic community and ask them to comment on some of the actions we are taking  i will be in touch when the time comes
 

starting july 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce names cost structure by over 200 million on an annual basis  additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both ebs and in ees to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities  as name has said though the basic business model and strategy of name is sound and promises continued growth  no changes there  for example in the name industrial markets and name global markets groups  efforts begun just over a year ago  we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these first mover businesses  successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model  combined with some long overdue focus on costs we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings
 

i left a message  name has stated publicly that succession will be internal so we wont be needing these guys
 

some background information for the meeting with mayor brown

brown won 43 of the vote to sanchez 40 and is now in a run off with sanchez  name waldens perspective not surprisingly is that brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters  african american turnout in the election was lower than expected but an active getoutthevote campaign could turn that around
name has supported the mayor with a 10000 contribution  i would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances
if you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration you could
congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition
compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since sept 11 and his handling of flood relief
you should know that the name police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the october 26 threat to the name building
we have responded to the citys rfp for energy service
ees made a presentation last week proposing a 57 year transaction
the city is opting for a 12 year transaction
that would require very detailed load data which is in reliants possession
we have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the citys effort to do a deal with reliant  we have said that we wont play on those terms
separately we are working with the city on a demand side deal
 

name horton called about the production tax credit for name wind name wind is one of the many companies hes responsible for and he is going to be getting more deeply involved at least on this issue  i will forward your latest update originally to name metts but i think you should provide a new update for name as well as a discussion of what we are doing or should be doing to get the extension
 

i think it would be useful to get in touch with the hr leadership and review what is being done and get their ideas on what they think should be done  more than anything i want the organization to know who to go to with their ideas and cut down on the noise level and the perception that we arent doing anything
 

see attached

name  please check for accuracy on some of the career milestones

name  please put on my letterhead
 

do we have an agenda andor presentation for the meeting with gov geringer  also i would like to see his speechespresentations and an overview of the business we have pending in wyoming
 

i have forwarded this to fitch  you should compare with your list and consolidate or have name consolidate onto one
 

attached is the draft release  i didnt mean to come across too pessimistic on the way in this am  the release does contain good news and we need toget it out as soon as we can
 

please prepare the letter to mclarty for my signature  please get me his phone number and get his fax number so we can fax as well as mail the letter
 

thanks name  its difficult to see so many smart hard working people in the kinds of circumstances you describe  unfortunately im going through some of the same things on a smaller scale  we are having to let people go in my organization  i simply dont have room even for a qualified person like name
does global markets still have a presence in singapore  if so perhaps there is an opportunity there
 

see below and look at attachment  in a subsequent message the comment was made that the drop off today is typical for post bid week activity
 

thank you i enjoyed our discussion very much and was very impressed with your accomplishments and experience  and yes i am learning how to use the blackberry reasonably well
 

some additional background on the california refund issue  consistent with what we discussed just some additional detail
 

here is a suggested lay quote for the special committee release

with the formation of this special committee and the attraction of additional capital which we are also announcing today we are taking care of the past and securing the future
 

i need the following changes to outlook

 i need my file folders to be active so that i can get stuff out of them and put stuff into them when i am working offline
i need my inbox to show all my messages including the large messages  i dont want to have to check in two places or more to review all my new messages  i also need to be able to access those large messages when i am working offline
 

i hope your blackberry is working better than mine has been over the last few days  i understand that name and name have spoken and that name name and name will be coming over at 300 and no one is expected to be there at 100  correct
 

i know this is not technically an employee relations issue but it looks like the kind of thing you have dealt with before  i agree with name  there is little point showing this to name  but you personally know him better so i leave it to you
 

we should get the focus off of micromanaging ferc  this isnt about a federal agency this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms  obviously our view is that fercs approach at least so far appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable secure and affordable power 

 i like the gerrymandering message  a process dependent on compromise eg a legislative body like congress is going to produce a camel and that wont work for customers  truth be told it was this same kind of compromised political consensusbuilding exercise which produced ab 1890 and the resulting debacle in californias energy market
 

we are looking for more motivational speakers and working around a less grandiose theme  restoring confidence overcoming adversity etc  name name is working with name on speakers  it may be worth discussing at the management committee today
 

name name is still an open question
i think its fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place  are they transferring  or just responsibilitiy
i want to show name the yeartoyear differences 20020012002 and show transfers into the organization eg from ebs transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount
im not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics they havent worked in the past
 

the board has asked for a draft communications plan  attached is an outline  obviously it is a bit premature to finalize the plan so this presentation just reviews different scenarios


314	i found the 142 mw discrepancy  fixed it too  but im still off with you  your sales and purchases dont match by 2 mw  i agree wtih 4326 total mwhs
	purchases 89577678

name  name 

do you have any good points of reference on the history of natural gas restructuring

name
 

should we include name cantrell on these calls

name
 

name 

looks good to me  ill discuss with amr to ensure his agreement

name
 

yes  although probably more useful if we have a smoking gun in the legislative arena  doe has no authority over tva

name
 

it will be difficult to understand the impact of our credit decline on a per transaction basis  it is probably sufficient to communicate with the credit department under name name for wholesale and the ews services group under name hughes for retail

i spoke with name hughes and he is going to have csc run a report of the tariff obligations  he will send the info to me and ill forward to amr name

thanks
 

thanks for the feedback  

your model now assumes a modification to the distribution tariff to include a new rate element  that may get around the settlement although oca in pa will think that now d is going up and there is no offset in the g rate so consumers are getting screwed because they wont switch  

also can the papuc implement this charge and direct the edcs to transfer the funds to thirdparty generators  seems like that would require legislative changes  

i like the idea that there should be fixed charge for icap  one way to get that number would be to go back to the edc stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony  remember if they are earning more from the market than that  amount they are overearning on their stranded costs

name
 

name 

add this to the report database

thanks

name
 

after the phc today we should have a better feel where the parties are and what the discussions will provide for  name can you make sure that name and team have a synopsis and outline of next steps

thanks
 

i think the best person to provide the affidavits for the px credit receivable is name curry if we want to make this claim inside of the ferc proceeding  still an open question

name
 

name 

like we spoke about yesterday the key play here will be to understand the retail opportunities  let me know how your efforts to get a good synopsis goes  namet forget to use name thome to help in this effort

name
 

please print and ensure that name bestard has this info

name
 

name 

lets discuss on todays refund call

thanks

name
 

call ozzie pagan

name
 

name 

with ees push into serving smaller customers the issues in this situation  potential affiliate abuse and unfair sharing of information  will become more important  when ees focused on national outsourcing this was less an issue because our products crossed many jurisdictions  

this issue of course is especially important in recently opened or opening markets as the affiliates try and secure large market share  we are also watching for these activities in places like mi va and oh  

name
 

can we change the project lead on the rto nopr on standards of conduct to be both name yoho and name lawner

also can you call the project leads before the memo goes out to make sure that they are aware of their responsibilities  just a heads up

in paragraph 2 your language is that this is addressed only to the people on the chart  i think that name intends to send out to everyone in ga  maybe we want to change to indicate that people are welcome to be included in teams if they were not mentioned

thanks

name
 

name 

name kean needs to talk with some analysts today about our ca exposures  can you send me your most recent information on our wholesale and negative ctc exposures as soon as possible  call me with questions

name
 

agree  in fact this was name names only problem  my position would be to simplify bingamans language to not define any organization

name
 

include on the report

name
 

should we try and agree with the other market participants on a list of issue prior to the meeting  maybe coordination also with ferc staff prior to the meeting  namet want to appear that this is ganging up but we do need to be prepared to go in with a clear idea of what is a good meeting

name
 

ok  im booked all week but next week i can do it

name
 

per our conversation today 

1	name name is working with arem to a work on an alternative vehicle for da  the bowen bill b get the taking argument for retroactive cpuc action to norm plotkin and name katz c call aps energy services to motivate boeing d getting arem active on the date issue

by the way name name heard that the cpuc has received hundreds of letters related to the cpuc decision

2	everyone should be working to get customers focused on messaging to the a governors office and b trade associations

key messages	1	namet have the cpuc make wrong decision tomorrow
			2	sb78 can work if da suspension date  sept 101 or later
			3	setting this da suspension date does not mean that customers name escape fair surcharges

i am putting together a gameplan right now for who to call and the messages

3	i called name yamane at marathon communications re ceo contacts  once i receive the list well make a decision on how to proceed with that group

4	hedy is working to get hertzberg and any others to call the cpuc and seek another delay

5	name day  can you please draft language to use on the assembly floor to fix sb78 per our interests  hedy  bev who should support the amendment  namet we need a member to carry the provision  wouldnt it be better if we had cmta or the ca restaurant association  is this possible

6	name govenar is calling boeings lobbyist to get them interested

thanks everybody  keep up the great work

name
 

name 

we should probably file something on this cpuc docket just ensuring that if these meters are put in place esps have access on a timely basis to the data if they serve the customer da  what do you think  maybe the vinio could help

name
 

name 

do we need to replace name on the reg project list

name
 

ill ask around floor  given my background this position does not sound like the best fit  id rather be more on the longterm contracting origination side or business development  thanks for the inquiry  

as you know things are pretty crazy right now here at name  i intend to take the week off after thanksgiving and intend to give you a call during that period  have a great thanksgiving

name
 

name

name
 

name 

i received a call today from the cpuc came through the main name number  a cpuc staffer named name at 4157032199 no one was interested in giving the last names

someone named name at the quail ridge research station 7001 hwy 128 napa ca 94558 called the cpuc to complain that he was inappropriately switched from pge to name  its a strange situation  the universities own the bldg and land but a trust pays the bills  he says that the facility isnt anywhere near the campus

the pge account number is znl8242005  his phone number is 5037520873  

i told him that we would look into this and get back by end of business thursday

the cpuc staffer is name at 4157032199 no one was interested in giving the last names

my guess is that uccsu listed this account on a switch request but didnt ask name  what should we do

name
 

i think that we should support the effort  i would not get into the specifics in any region or the specifics of the proceedings  this should be an opportunity for name to spin its message  rtos help us help our customers

name
 

name and name 
 
are you the right people to discuss payment or modified credit terms for epmi  the issue with nepool is that our uicmpnstar wholesale reqts deals would be harmed if we dont pay these guys  
 
i dont know if we should pay but i need to figure out who is on point for paying if that decision is reached
 
i know that name llodra is trying to sell these positions
 
name
 

do all reps have to report this information  including our customer complaints  even if we only serve nonptb customers  who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it  do the business people understand this obligation

name
 

am i scheduled to attend

name
 

name 

give me a call about this and item 1 below

name
 

what do you think that about having kerry take the lead on all mapp area rtos while also supporting roan in misoarto  not top priority but i think this could be a good opportunity

name
 

the best outcome is that there is an obligation to dispose of load through this but the mechanism is negotiated

name
 

name 

to your point 3burr 

probably want to bring in name montovano on the nc puc question  we have worked with a local lawyer in the past i think her name is name name that could help with this question and demonstrate that having an rto does not make a state deal with retail competition any sooner than it wants to deal with the question  name montovano could probably be of assistance here  maybe bring in name to dc to deal directly with the staff

name
 

name  name 

who should process this

name
 

i think that names write up is great  ive only changed two things  if anyone has any more changes please get to name asap

name
 

name

name
 

name 

spoke with name dietrich yesterday  slight change to our advocacy versus our monday discussions  after meeting with name holmes it was agreed that our policy work would say 1 no retroactive da suspension at least not earlier than sept 1 2 dont end da but study how to allow it to continue

if the cpuc does suspend without retroactive the fear is that restarting the ca market will be very difficult

please call me when you get some time

name

name 

doesnt it make sense that we are disadvantaged visavis their own transmission service and should talk to name fulton about a complaint at ferc

name
 

name 

the email i referenced in my voice mail  please call if you have any information

name
 

name 
 
thanks  looks good  some thoughts for you to consider
 
1    not sure that impact 1 makes sense to present  no real reason to set ctc  0 ckwh on jan 5 calpx was still in operation  i think that impact 2 better captures the idea  also probably not good to use the term ctc eliminated  maybe should say ctc  0 ckwh  given the cpucs march 27 order the utilities have a claim for additional generation related stranded costs until march 31 2002
 
2     in calculating impact 2 what did you use as the jan 19  aug baseline  did you calculate the hit of 1045 from actual bills or based on our dj index model there is a fundamental difference in likelihood based on the baseline  also i assume that the feb  aug timeframe was relatively low because ees and eemc had most of their load on bundled service
 
3    probably should discuss in a footnote the different models for px credit calculation and most specifically the pge adjustment  also may be interesting to have the  impact of the pge adjustment the rate adjustment to recapture their previous mistake  i think that this is something we need to go into the cpuc to fight pretty quickly
 
4    should impact 4 and impact 5 apply to sces loads  in column 4 it looks like it does  sce is not currently hitting our bills with this surcharge
 
5    probably better to model impact 5 as of oct 1 not sept 1
 
6    can you break out the volumes for vintage contracts versus retail gen with passthru contracts  you havent shown anything for a utility undercollection costs or b cdwr bond fees  these costs may hit our vintage contracts

name
 

i wanted to make sure that you had seen the language name references that 1 explicitly recognize the px credit as part of names undercollection and 2 permit name to pay debts associated with the negative px credit  in the earlier email  call me with any questions

name
 

what was the explicity capacity kwmo component by year for peco in their stranded cost case  feel free to call jr

name
 

ill go to the name meeting

name
 

name 

i agree with your arguments  the other problem with sces analysis is that they had a defined stranded cost amount and they deserve that money 

what california did my explaination is that sce was offered frozen rates for 4 years  all of the margin they earned was shareholders compensation for moving to direct access  if the total  of margin was 0 or less this implies simply that sce had no generation stranded costs 

the entire argument that sce is making forgets the billion that they have kept from consumers through the fixed rate
 

can we talk at 9am your time  lots going on  

name
 

i will be setting up a conference call for later today to discuss our latest view on developments in the california market  if anyone has any specific questions before then please call me at 7138537673

please attend if possible
 

name 
 
my thoughts on the filing
 
1    pretty hard line with comm wood  i dont have any problems with it as written but comments like cya not calif youth admin is not appropriate
2    we dont deal with the requirement to submit contracts  should arem address this  my understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something maybe with the price and term blackedout  is this correct
3    in the conclusion dont we want to ask the puc to take some affirmative action  tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension that their is no cost shifting and that da customers can extend without penalty  the filing simply asks for no harm  
 
thanks

name
 

thanks  appreciate the concern  hopefully most of this will be legal time   but one never knows

name
 

thought you should see this

name
 

name 

i think that we need to talk with ews tariff risk to make sure that we are on the same page  i am concerned that some of names statements may not end up happening with the final tariffs

please advise

name
 

a few notes

1	be cautious about divestiture  remember we own pipes and a electric ldc

2	agree with you that we dont want utility in merchant role  key issue

3	polr issue involves getting pricing right

why dont you put together a note to the caem that we can send as our thoughts  just the top 5 issues

name
 

the statements

name
 

your message was forwarded to me regarding name allegretti and npcc   can you please let me know what names role was in the organization and any other information

name
 

not too sure how important but wanted everyone to see the discussion from jamie wimberley at caem  

name
 

name 

do you have a listing of all bonds that ees and its affiliates has in place for retail marketing including wholesale isos speaking with name we dont keep this information in govt affairs  name fite keeps bond information required in the state licensing processing  the place that i think that is missing is wholesale service providers eg isos

i think that we need to expand this idea of bonding to financial guarantees including with utilities states and wholesale service providers

maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from ees active markets and determine what is needed in each locale

thanks

name
 

here are my comments given my very short review of the nga statement

1834	demand response 	good

185	improving energy transmission	ok	
	talks about equal access for all suppliers  
	even though says oppose preemption indicate a willingness to better coordinate

186	regulatory 
	hard to read if the section on no preemption of state regulatory authority is good or badwe dont argue that our model preempts any authority only that transmission service is best defined by ferc

name
 

fyi  you may want to send out to rto team

name
 

fair points  my dogma machine is running at high today  namet disagree with your thoughts  lets get the answer that works for the business for the longterm
 
name
 

not sure  it was stated rather quickly in passing
 

name 

how is everything going  wanted to make sure that i hadnt been unresponsive to the project  anything critical that you need from me  please let me know

name
 

lets set up the meetings  namet you think

name
 

name 

name is looking for about 1500 for tuition reimbursement  i would if we can afford it pay this  i indicated that going forward we could not make any committments but finishing his college would be helpful

thoughts

name
 

name 

have you and name brown talked about the mg deal  i want to make sure that you understand fully and appreciate any issues  concerns

thanks
 

aleck 

name try and find  not sure if the material is responsive  read the article sending to others on to list  maybe name brenner can help you pull a response together

name
 

following last weeks meeting here is my recommendation on how to proceed with sce

1	form name negotiation team

	my recommendation is to use the same team we used with pge  name dasovich  my understanding was that name m was the lead negotiator  i would not change this  name should only be there to make introductions

2	meet  confer 1029

	name name and name dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens  

3	reformed stipulation

	i would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document  based on dasovichs idea to get together with sce on thursday maybe let this ride

4	meeting

	my understanding is that name d please correct sce can meet with us this thursday  can everyone make it that needs to be there  probably meet in california  we should put the laundry list on the table

please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees

thanks

name
 

thanks for the draft  name circulate internally and respond

name
 

name 

i would have epmi be the party of record  also please make sure that name lindberg gets a copy of all filings to pass along to the midwest desk

thanks

name
 

here are my thoughts 

1	agree that offering transmission provider waiver given rto status is premature
2	maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled provider of last resort type service and bundled utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition  at a minimum in places like pa where the utility sales service is a direct competitor there should be no difference with any competitive player  in a state like ga where the utility sales service is a monopoly by statue ie bundled retail i still think given the ability to cogenerate it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale  maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus  i fully agree to include these providers in the definition
3	name call name n to discuss examples of how native load exemption has caused problems weve put in earlier filings
4	the question of holding company etc  we should argue for an exemption
5	i am also troubled by the administer term  ferc should prohibit any helping by the transmission provider of anyone in the marketplace  maybe focus ferc on clarifying its positions
6	emergency sections  keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry and could be a real problem given a caiso type situation  ask name comnes for thoughts  probably dont object but want to make sure that if emergency develops there must a preset timeframe for going back to normal business
7	everything filed at the ferc related to standards of conduct should be posted on the oasis

i didnt understand the final bullet point comments  is this policy or a statement of something to come

name
 

i plan on attending

name steffes
 

name 

i received a call from name brown who said that he had visited the nypsc and nyiso to discuss load curtailment  he had placed a few calls into you and hadnt heard back

when you get back please let me know where this stands  no big deal but i want to understand what is going on with the load curtailment efforts

name
 

please add so we can get to name on monday

name
 

id let name make the call  as long as we understand the issues well maybe no reason to take commercial to the mtg

name
 

name 

what does this do to our current book of customers on msg  name our  margin evaporate  is there some other solution on how to restructure the fe retail market  what wholesale issues does fe need to change to help the ews desk

name
 

well  namet they got themselves in a pickle

name
 

please include as appropriate

name
 

we need to discuss the economics of this on our book assuming that these costs hit our pocket and not our customers

name
 

thanks  let me know how the desk sees it  also please make sure that we talk with ees gas name black

name
 

thanks for keeping name and name name informed  i give this chance a very low probability right now but well see

name
 

thanks for the update  it is disappointing that aga is not opening the process although the final eisb retail gas standards will need to be vetted by an ansi group so well get our comments in one way or the other

also what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocols across the board  seems like pushing naruc to agree that this is the right vehicle makes sense 

thanks

name
 

id say we want tariff language before any investigation  i dont typically like investigations  i like complaints  my thought is to presell tariff changes to ferc with a broad coalition and then get the ohio puc to ask ferc the question

name
 

interesting  seems to me that epsa needs to help az do better by its citizens  its not just aps thats a bunch of neanderthals to use a name shapiro phrase 

i dont understand something else  is mumaw aps and ees counsel in az  how is this possible

name
 

name 

did we send this

name
 

sorry that i am just getting back to this  i think that one of the key roles for reg risk analytics is to validate the appropriateness of regulatory assumptions in ews retail tariff curves as well as help govt affairs build risk management plans  

lets talk soon

name
 

lets talk early next week
 

on coalitions i was thinking about other market participants  agreed that cinergy could be the vehicle  also maybe make an informal presentation to ferc before any filing etc

name
 

name 

you should also attend

name
 

name 

whats the latest on the pge imbalance method

name
 

pls hold for inclusion in cpuc letter today

name
 

pls incorporate as appropriate into our presentation

name
 

i didnt calendar or at least i dont remeber  when will this happen

name
 

name 

if the one rto doesnt have a dayahead market what happens

name
 

a couple of points 

1	the language in the relief indicates that we are trying to determine the validity and amount of px credits owed to ees and eemc  is this correct  isnt our primary goal in this complaint to a have the utility return the net credit to our bills and b to allow for recoupment againts all nongeneration related charges

2	throughout the document the idea of td charges is used  i assume that this is shorthand for all nongeneration related charges  we pay ctc and public purpose costs as well as td

3	not sure if cpuc regulates the esps  the filing makes this case in the first paragraph

thanks

name
 

name 

how about a call tomorrow to discuss

name
 

pls let me know

name
 

pseg called yesterday to ask for an lc or cash collateral of 10 mm to displace our corporate guarantee of 13 mm  they are sending more information in a letter to name name copied to me  there is a 5 day turnaround  early next week this will be due

name
 

ok  but if this case ends up in settlement we should have our priorities outlined before the case

name
 

name 

my only question is one of emphasis  are points 34 the key for name t  if so should we move them up higher  also why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points  the length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate  maybe a list of bullet points up front

name
 

thanks for the info  not sure what were doing  ill pass this along

name
 

name 

sbx2 18 and sbx2 85 are important to follow

i would think that name comnes would be good if he can make it to go

name
 

thanks luiz  as a followup id like to be on record as saying that the puct wasted my time in flying to name when plane travel is not secure id add and not even listening to my statements  why bring us if they had already made the decision  also i dont know who is going to pay for more market readiness work in spp unless aep agrees to pay our costs  the customers pay for their activities

thx
 

name  name 

we need to be coordinating on this  you both met with these people at different times  i dont want to be creating work or stepping on each other  i dont think there is any problem but lets sit down and coordinate

thanks

name
 

fine  same here

name
 

no 
yeung  lindberg are gone

name steffes
name
 

the ppo  power purchase option  is a unique program based on the il restructuring law  texas has no analogous service  

i agree with your statement that we dont need an rto we need to fix the physical retail transmission rules  its important to keep consistent messages

name
 

erin 

name is working right now to try and develop its policy on this issue  clearly our primary goal is to ensure that market makers such as name are treated fairly by the ferc rules visavis other market participants  while we are not yet enamored with any policy option we are committed to helping ferc do whatever is necessary to create a strong and well functioning marketplace

as soon as i have any more ill let you know  name novosel and i are intending to come to the meeting

name
 

name 

the only way to collect the overpayment is to artificially reduce the px credit going forward to thereby allow for more ctc

name
 

does epsa agree that ferc should require all transmission providers should agree to an rto of the fercs choosing or lose mbr for all affiliates  thats the other message name should put out

name
 

name 

pls print attachment

name
 

name 

name would be willing to move forward with the boston pacific study at the 15k level

thanks

name
 

please coordinate a meeting with name for later this week between name and myself

name
 

name  

are you going  the list looks pretty good  if not we may need to have someone there
 
name
 

dasovich this is in your court
 
name
 

not until all of the key electricity fixes are included in the package  remember rtos are still voluntary the courts have yet to require ferc to do away with the native load exception and nerc is in charge of reliability  this is clearly the biggest issue for the publics

name
 

so the short answer is that ees needs to change its procedures  also is the 50kw right for all markets

name
 

in what forum will this be discussed

name
 

not sure how this got through the process  please feel free to call on me if this isnt getting fixed right  also should we just have pge pull the application and refile with different terms

also name you should let amr know and keep track  he can try and quantify

name
 

name 

i see that you are on the panel on market monitoring  name perrino and name comnes are following the issue for name in the western power markets as rtos are formed  it may make sense for some people from govt affairs to talk with you to discuss current issues and focus of ferc and others  if we can get together please let me know a good time

also the attached paper from epsa on market monitoring is something we support through our trade association

thanks

name
 

any time you want to you should feel free

name
 

name  name 

the spinmisters are already at work  people at ferc thought we had bought into the new nerc name does not support nerc in working through commercial issues  we need to develop our opinions of where to go next but right now you can respond to name nevius that we still dont believe that nerc and its processorganziation is the right vehicle  we are willing to find a way to do this but we cant have the same sro bullshit that they have been saying for 3 years

sorry i missed the call  ill talk with you guys friday

name
 

name  name 

do we have to do something related to this  thanks

name


note also that in a separate development ferc
simultaneously opened a broad investigation under section
206 of the federal power act to apply the new
marketbasedsales policy to all us sellers nationwide
what this means is that although only three utilities are
mentioned in this initial order it is expected that ferc
will continue to take steps to constrain what it believes
to be erratic wholesale markets reportedly some 30
companies are awaiting similar reviews by ferc to
determine if the commission believes they exert market
power the 206 investigation reportedly also requires
power providers with marketbased sales authority to amend
their tariffs within 60 days to provide ferc with
openended authority to order refunds if the commission
determines that market manipulation has occurred
 

name 

look at the letter from caem below  they want us to sign on  not sure that name adding its name is the best idea  also are the sections listed the right ones  maybe we can change this without our name

name

name steffes
name
 

name and name are in the building  name where can i find you to discuss some issues

can you please add name cantrell name pharms and name canovas to your nat gas weekly discussions  not sure if they will all come but id like someone from government affairs at the meeting to try and keep us uptodate on the issues

name
 

the ews west power urm desk will need to determine the  at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response  its their   so far my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations as outlined in the name smith memo are the preferred outcome  ill reconfirm

name
 

yes this gets at my issues  i want to build your matrix and names together  no where do we deal with reporting yet  also we need to have some systematic approach to updates and naming point people

name
 

name 

going forward govt affairs will coordinate with services and product development and other ews and ees groups as appropriate eg credit to ensure compliance with 1 licensingregistration 2 bondingsecurity 3 regulatory reporting and 4 other  i have asked name ogenyi to lead this effort for us  we will need other groups to appoint a lead for their teams as soon as possible i will work with name legal and product development to find out the appropriate people

i fully concur with name that within all new product development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity   as important just because we dont want to attract new business in a given market doesnt mean that our responsibilities have ended  we need to ensure that our product development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the longterm  to ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations i would recommend that name be on the product development signoff sheet

in addition we have already begun reviewing obligations etc for our current market activity both wholesale and retail  i will talk with name to build the matrix of issues you referenced  our goal is to make current all of our market obligations

i will call you to provide an update on the market review when i have more information  if you want to talk about this please call

thanks

name

ps  ill ask name to give you an update on the il bonding status

do we know if ci has feared so poorly  what are the problems with entering the market for those customers  have these customers been angry or pleased

name
 

name 

fine work looks like we are moving forward in the se  

a couple of discussion points    i am still not so much in love the lmp as this paper makes it seem you are i dont believe there is a perfect solution  also the document is not consistent relating to control area consolidation  for instance the issue around ca or rto with tagging makes no sense if there is only one ca  the rto  this is important to highlight to the alj  the easiest way to solve the problem is to do away with the archaic systems of the old world  also i still dont fully understand why we are happy that the sac gets to pick the ima  i personally despise the concept of a sac  never has worked when times get tough  also no real discussion or maybe i missed of timing to implement  next phase

anyway great work in the mediation  keep pushing these guys from the south

name
 

name 

looks very good  we need to stress the points on what we need ferc to do  fix their mistakes in the rehearing  one other point maybe we should stress that ferc could open these proceedings and not delay the decision because the cal iso is taking so long  also dont be shy about describing how the process is going so slowly and the abuses of the cal iso and its lack of independence

name
 

some more information would be nice  these seem low

name
 

name 

name kingerski informed me that you and some team members were going to visit coned to discuss the benchmark rate swap  i think its a great idea name gahn and i had discussed something similar a few years ago when he ran urm  

my only thoughts for you would be 1 maybe difficult to do the swap with the utility given puc oversight but the holding company should be in the same place financially and should be protected from puc scrutiny and 2 being long td assuming that you dont sell 100 of the position to customers creates interesting regulatory questions

id love to sit down with you to discuss this product

with the cancellation of a number of surety bonds by our providers we are faced with a potential credit crunch in nepool  

also it is my understanding although i havent seen anything that our nov 2001 bills are due in all of the markets on dec 20 2001

name
 

name 

good job

on the hourly market price index until we have lmp dispatch the best we can do is a public index  lets not ask for too much  just something we can hedge against  can you talk with the ews folks for the best index option

also if the default is a monthly public index why do the customers need any parking  they can move directly to the new option

what is your definition of functioning wholesale market  are we stating that unless an rto is running we cant get rid of the ppo  maybe just resolve the imbalance issue  more specifics would be helpful

thanks

name
 

name 

my take on this letter is that it is a little too jumpy  any way to help make it a bit more to help lynch do something different  maybe work from the arem filing

name
 

we have not made public the sce amount as far as im aware  we need to make sure that ir is in the loop  i think that name koenig is following this issue

name
 

please get this to fundamentals

thanks

name
 

a couple of thoughts 

1	ashley brown and name have a great relationship  namet hesitate to use name to find out some details if you need him

2	are we supporting this  i dont understand why we would agree to make ng the mm with this process  paper

thanks
 

makes sense to me  good luck  let me know if you need anything

name
 

there was a discussion today involving home depot and our inaction regarding not having sent out a dasr

to make sure that we are all on the same page please let me know if anyone disagrees with the following 

1	we meaning ees broadly do have customers with metered demand greater than 1 mw otherwise known as nonprice to beat

2	for nonprice to beat customers that have not been dasrd or have no contract the affiliated rep will provide service to the customer beginning on their first meter reading after jan 1 2002 under a blanket term of service agreement let me know if you want copies under the following price terms 
txu energy services cost  5 per kw for demand based on highest demand in last 12 months  50mwh  100month  delivery costs  taxes  
reliant energy services cost  15  daily gas index  kwh  115  capacity price  kw billing demand  490month  delivery costs  taxes

3	if the customer does not pay their bill they will then be placed on polr service

4	the arep offers monthtomonth service with a 30 calendar day notice provision for cancellation

5	next opportunity to dasr these customers will be dec 16 2001

6	when we find a buyer for the texas book or all of the company ees intends to obtain permission from the customer to assign the nonprice to beat customers  this implies that we will not be sending out the optout provision to nonprice to beat customers

name
 

do we need to have a meeting to work through this  what outside counsel is supporting the sale right now

name
 

thanks  the key of course is to create a filing that could not be used against us at ferc on these issues  i guess that amending the filing is better than withdrawing the filing and resubmitting  my only thought would be that by withdrawing pge provides no trail
 
name
 

we need to be very cautious about signing on to documents that seek to delay the start date of any rto  unless and until i hear something different from ferc my going in assumption is that name will be one of the only voices on this issue  we should only give on this issue when real value is being created 

why not file a me too on the issue of seating of the board wo agreeing to everything else

name
 

fyi  epsa looks interested in undertaking a costbenefit analysis  as soon as i hear more ill give everyone the info

not quite sure that i am getting the picture  let me lay it out more directly

the px credit for october 2000 was 225 based on the actual market rates

now ferc is saying that october 2000 hourly prices for calpx da and calpx ha markets were too high in june 2001  can the cpuc change the px credit for october 2000 and make the utilities recalculate our negative ctc

what is prospective  have they ever done this before

can you coordinate with name name at 5034648860 on how to change the filing if at all on pges pipeline issue  pge is willing to modify the filing to try and take out the language on native load  they are suggesting that maybe they should sign a contract for the full amount of the capacity about 170000 mmcfd rather than assume its right

the goal should be to have a final decision on next steps before next friday aug 17

when are you going to send the letter

name
 

i think that this is a good step but we need to remember that nerc in the commercial sector may not prove to be the end all  also while rtos may enforce the standards or set the standards not sure if we want one organization doing both

name
 

im on my way to dc  please ask my asst to set a good time to call with you on wed

name
 

name 

before we do anything on this issue i would suggest that we need to have developed a strategy on a number of issues primarily the proper reformation of the px credit calculation after jan 18 and the application of the 1ckwh surcharge

on this issue assuming that we havent discuss the failure of sce to apply our accounts past credit with the cpuc given that the bills were just received i cant imagine that a federal court would look to favorably upon a legal action  

in addition we have not identified where the credits are if they are not on the customers accounts  

my recommendation is to first a work with sce  have name dasovich run the traps and b discuss the issue with cpuc division of energy and see if there is a solution without complaint 

if this doesnt get us anywhere before august 19 then it seems that to protect our interest we would need to file a complaint with the cpuc  i am not opposed to lebouef looking into federal action but that seems a bit dramatic without first trying to exhaust our adminstrative remedies

please call me

name

ps there is a meeting on the 1ckwh surcharge with name dietrich today at 130 in her office  i think you should attend
 

i agree that we are losing money  thats not the reason for getting out of this case  what is the upside  even if we win we are only forcing ferc to reconsider at some later time  is this really the best strategy

name
 

did you attend  did we file comments  

name
 

name 

any decision on the payment

you should contact name smith in ees legal  he is the one to respond to this allegation  my fax is 7136468160

1	the best split is probably just 5050 on personnel  while everyone is in a specific box on the org chart many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles  the  on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward for example if ees wants something specific on a state puc matter
2	in terms of approving outside service expenditures i would like to sit down with you name and name to work out what the best method of working through the approvals  i will try and set up some time the first week of december
4	i have put name montovano in the ne gas box  this will increase the budget by 400k based on historical figures  i have attached a new org chart to represent this change

also name staines who is not on the org chart has an employment contract that ends 6122002  name has been working on florida and northeast rto matters and continues to help east power with the nyiso tcc auction  we can sever him but his contract will need to be paid off 87k  govt affairs also has a contract for support with joe name exsouthern exec to support our se activities  i am trying to get a copy of the contract but i think that it is in place until 802  my recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today    

thanks

fine by me  not sure if id make so much of the recent ferc statements  may come true if we dont keep a straightforward message

1 profitrto  where does your proposed organization fit in the attached graph in terms of end state  stage iii stage iv

 

2 regarding document response of national grid usa to questions posed by the commission does it imply that core for profit functions should not be subject to a stakeholder process wasnt the neta design subject to an extensive 
consultation even for profit ng core functions

3 if each transco manages it own oasis how can we avoid fragmentation balkanization pancaking and many other
negative aspects and seams that the rto process is trying to eliminate how can you achieve onestop shopping by outsourcing those functions to one single third party

4 as a follow up question what are the mechanisms to assure that this potential fragmentation may lead to underinvestments in t particularly in important intertie investments

5 what kind of pbr mechanism are you envisioning for the transcorto are you thinking about including external measures such as cost to provide ancillary services congestion costs or costs incurred in energy balancing

6 are you envisioning an rtotransco model which will assume that all transmission assets in the region will be divested or can the model live with a light rto where part of the assets are divested but others are not and sign an operating agreement with the rto would your proposed matrix of rto functions page 9 still be robust under this scenario

7 can your proposed rto model dovetail with an lmpcongestion management system based on financial rights our understanding is that neta completely reorganized the uk pool the uk system now looks like a selfdispatch physical rights model 

8 as a follow up of the previous question assuming alliance adopts a selfdispatch physical rights approach similar to the one ng operates in the uk today namet you think that this will create significant barriersseams with other neighboring rtos considering that there seems to be a general trend towards security constrained dispatch lmp and financial rights for most rtos in the us

9 if your proposed system can be dovetailed to a central dispatch lmpfinancial rights shouldnt some functions in your martix of rto functions be collapsed for example management of congestion prices calculation of congestion operations of energy markets and generation redispatch

10 procurement and deployment of ancillary services is listed as noncore however in the uk system this represents a significant role of the transco with incentives and penalties attached to its achievement is there a different vision or do you assume that those functions will end up being developed by the rto and consequently will be part of the pbr formula

11 generation interconnection obviously your proposal did not go that far conceptually do you favor a system whereby t fixed costs are recovered via a postage stamp rate across an entire region or do you favor the uk model whereby fixed costs use of the system are calculated based on incremental cost and have a strong locational component and connection costs are treates separately according to a shallow method

12 establishment of transmission rates how to reconcile the fact that those should be regulated and you propose that the transco itself will establish its t rates are you thinking about some possible nonregulated activities

13 you stated that separation and control of t assets persists to a large extent in the collaborative model proposed as part of the southeast mediation do you think that the independent system administration model is superior in this regard what are the key important differences in your view in the conceptual design of those models
 

lets discuss at 5pm
 

name 

two issues that we should work on  first energy discusses cbm not sure of their position and mapsa deals with icap  my recollection is that icap will not be addressed at this time  seems to me that we should  try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 1103  what do you think  on cbm now is the time for ferc to get rid of this discriminatory practice

name

can you please send me the most recent version  thanks
 

what do i need to do

name
 

i agree with name that the reporting issues are important  i also think that focusing on the lessons learned from the ne rto and se rto mediation would be interesting  have people from different industry groups discussing their views of where the mediations concluded assuming we are finished by october  any outstanding issues between epsa members and between epsa and other parts of the industry could be discussed

thanks

eemc has filed in md for a gas license  it is on the calendar for this wednesday  

there have been a number of letters sent dealing with questions on our license  govt affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the puc given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record  we would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues

if anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item please let me or name kingerski know as soon as possible

thanks

name
 

fyi  the first memo
 

lower rates first  they still dont get it
 

name   anywhere that we have supplier consolidated billing name put up some form of credit to cover 45 days of utility charges  so while i am unsure of the form of collateral if name provides a list of where we are doing supplier consolidated billing we should be able to construct a collateral obligation worksheet  we also have collateral in each iso neiso nyiso pjm caiso  

it will take some time to dedasr to dual billing and until our accounts switch the utilities will hold the collateral

a	a good resource for you
b	also if anything is intersting may want to add  key would be mi nv and va discussions

name
 

name 

here is the org chart that captures our discussions  i think that this org and the  of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees

total headcount  21  the personnel cost  64 mm total for ena and ees    

please let me know if you have any questions

name
 

how about 9am tomorrow

name
 

no need to prepare anything  theyll do most of the talking

name
 

have we done my travel for nerc meeting in vancouver

name
 

please enter into my calendar


name
 

name 

lets talk  

we are arguing against nerc but name needs to understand that something must be in its place we have a policy that we are supporting  giving reliability to ferc  and that is names approach  have you communicated that to name  

also on rps and energy source reporting i agree but this may be a part of the final package  also the language i read allows the ftc to construct a process that makes it possible to not use day ahead markets

name
 

name  thanks  also feel free to send to joann hill in name

name
 

great news  are there any other md commissioners that ms mcdonald thinks we should visit with  

on the idea of nyiso vs pjm i was reading in restructuring today yesterday about some elements that ny thought was better than pjm  i think that we need to find three things to give to the nyiso in the development of a single marketallocation of ftrs comes to mind  i agree that pjm and its staff are the key elements but maybe getting over this rhetoric will be made easier if we concede that nyiso does something well

should we do another round of new england meetings to push our support  with mcgreevey winning in nj will the njbpu change its focus

name
 

thanks  we will discuss in context of state review

name
 

hey  maybe here for our anniversary

name
 

name 

i appreciate your note greatly  while we didnt always win we did always give the other side the fight of their lives  electricity markets in the midatlantic and throughout the country are better for the work you did over the last few years  

best of luck in your future plans  im sure that we will talk again and often

take care

name
 

pls print and have for my naruc phone call

name
 

i havent processed a bill
 

thanks  no major issues

name
 

name 

do we have a strong preference for what dstar utilities should do  i think that we want to communicate with omtr and others at ferc to push a single rto in the west leaving ca outside  also having the transco originally within the rto west makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the transco

name
 

thanks

it makes sense for name and name to get together i am available to talk tomorrow and have asked name to set something up  

also we need to work together to make sure that ees reports taxes and other requirements are filed in a timely fashion with the right internal groups

on the il bond issue there must be a disconnect between us and the icc  the icc believes that our bond isnt current  maybe we can figure this out together tomorrow

call if anyone has any questions  

name
 

i heard today that name nebergald will take over the ill market under name adams  ill try and track down all the facts

fyi  call if you need anything

name
 

name 

it seems to me that keeping the puc somewhat appeased makes sense  ill try and get some formal questions but sooner or later they will want to talk directly i appreciate that this is a pain but maybe its a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules

lets sit down on thursday am and talk

name
 

name 

where does this stand  i just read the text and agree with name  most importantly the hhi may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of comed service  

as important i dont think the icc cares too much about name losing market share  not the best lead argument

lets talk

name
 

name 

please work with name to determine if their calculations are tariff driven or simply an internal process of sce

thanks

name
 

jamie 

thanks for the external view on legislation  i agree that most of the bills dont get it right  the hope is that the ferc can do that without too much legislative guidance which of course would be wrong  not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work  not enough  to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities

name
 

name 

pls ask name name where these stand  i thought that the ferc didnt approve

name
 

name 

i will be traveling back from ca tomorrow so i cant make the call  some things to be aware of 

1	eeseemc v sce complaint

we filed aug 30 before the cpuc asking the cpuc to reinstate our customer net bill amounts  name dasovich will call name fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case or at least delay until after legislative session  if complaint moves forward sce will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes  name is preparing similar filing for pge although we need to seek relief from the stay  

2	california legislation

sce mou bill that includes da issues moved aug 29 through assembly energy committee  needs to go to assembly appropriation and full assembly  hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week  by removing the conservation easements the bill has lost some liberal democrats  governor name is asking business to find 15 republicans to move the bill  trying to modify 1 surcharge effective date to sept 1 and 2 get more comfort that sce will pay our negative ctc if  exists

also the windfall profits bill has moved through assembly committee  it has to go through assembly appropriation and full assembly  name thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached

 

3	ag subpeona  sen dunn subpeona

litigation about both subpeonas was heard this week in sf and sacramento  name kirby believes that he may have swayed the court in the sen dunn to provide a protective order  a final decision may be issued next week

4	ferc refund case

name presented its ripple claim earlier this week  range of refunds nonnetted is very large please see name name for exact   i have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by name comnes  oral testimony is being prepared in pnw case for next week

 

5	ne rto mediation  se rto mediation

both proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the alj issues a recommendation next week or soon thereafter  looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single ne rto energy market is nov 03 pjm thinks it can happen by may 03 but wants some cushion  name novosel is trying to best position us visavis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier  also icap and control area consolidation is not considered at this time  name nicolay believes that the alj will recommend moving toward a pjm model

6	cpuc decision to suspend da retroactive

name name continues to push the cpuc to remove the retroactive date in the current proposed decision  some rumors that the cpuc will again delay a decision until sept 13 confirming so please keep close
 

name name  is this for both ees and eemc  is epmi in this bill  can we pay separately by company

name
 

name 

if youre in on friday lets sit down for 15

thanks

name
 

id have name lindberg and name take on this
 
name
 

here is another file
 

name 

ferc has already filed a policy statement providing for cost recovery of security upgrades assuming they are reasonable  i know that the bush admin will now have the response as its top priority  i think that it will take a couple of weeks before we really understand the implications for further energy reform  ferc postponed announcing its work plan this week but my guess is that chairman wood will continue down his course  

retail competition in different states was already under fire from the california situation  not sure if this weeks events will have any major changes

thanks
 

on point 1  i think that at the end of the day ferc will not deal with the negative ctc directly  all they will do is reset prices  the utilities and the cpuc will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the px credit and hence the negative ctc  we have tried in the ca refund process to highlight the fact that much of the high prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the cpuc governor and utilities  the core problem with this line of argument is that the refund process didnt ask the first question  what or who is to blame  it simply took dysfunction and ran  we are trying in the context of the rehearing case to ask ferc to restart with the right question  also remember that we arent going to have a solution in the ferc case until sometime next year probably after sce gets its money  finally i think that the right policy decision is not to rebill negative ctc but rather to prospectively recover the costs

on point 2  see point above  i doubt however that all high prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling

name
 

pls fax to sf office today

thanks

name
 

we should also make sure that name kaufman and name keene attend

name
 

name  name 

thanks for the update  i am concerned that customers are talking about having nerc deal with commercial matters without first agreeing to fercs control over everything 

we should discuss the goulding report when you return

name
 

a few thoughts before the ng meeting 

1	maybe we should as a team call transelect name buckman before our ng meeting  you may remember that transelect sent an initial letter into skilling to try and solicit our support for stopping the ng application to be managing member of the arto  i think that it would be good to call buckman and ask if he has a better idea than ng  we are right now stuck between two very bad answers  let aep and fe construct a managing member or have ng  maybe transelect has a better solution

2	chief issues with ng 
a	are they really independent  having a short position in ny and owning generation in ne effectively makes ng into a market participant  i think that name should make as a hold firm position that to operate an rto there can be no agreement with anything less than almost perfect independence
b	who do they feel the customer is  maybe we want to get name names take on their business model from the uk  it is critical that the new rto operators across the country view tradersmarketers and generators as their key customers  what form of regulation for cost recovery of their operating expenses do they want  pass thru pbr etc 
c	who writes the tariff  i would make a strong argument that the problem with most of the rto work to date has been that ferc has allowed the current incumbents to first write a bad tariff and then assign the provision of service under that tariff to someone who has very little if any control over future changes  the rto operator must be free to make changes to the tariff with only two constraints  1 must not restrict the ability to pay facility revenue reqts and 2 must not damage the assets  
d	do they intend to buildown transmission and how does this impact the energy markets  will their planning and construction processes impact any long term positions that epmi may take in the energy market  how do they manage to allow other merchant transmission into the business
e	how do they intend to provide balancing energy  the flip side of our fight on congestion management involves the pricing of energy imbalances  what is ng intending to do on this issue  does ng believe that multiple control areas makes sense for a single rto  does ng support unbalanceduncovered schedules dayahead  

also just to let people know kerry stroup will also be working on the midwest rto efforts going forward  please keep him included on the emails

latest information on cpuc decision 

commissioner bilas filed an alternative draft for the cpuc that would

	hold da suspension and have the cpuc conduct hearings that would work out details including impact on bonds and phasing ending of da
	resolved issues related to credits and payments of negative ctc and
	hold hearings dealing with bottomsup ratemaking for da

this is effectively an updated version of the alternate that bilas put out last time the cpuc considered this issue  it is a longshot that this alternative would be approved  

our current information is still that the cpuc will vote to suspend da as of sept 1

name

name 

to let you know where we stand on the cpucs investigation on da suspension  

1	name name is leading the effort to respond to the cpuc for name

2	we knew that the cpuc was at a minimum going to investigate how andor whether to allow extensions of contracts and the application of other surcharge  to da load given their earlier statements  the issue on retroactivity is open primarily because they can ask these questions and i believe as leverage for other issues

3	we are coordinating with the big customers who recently left  they are marshalling forces to oppose any retroactivity  this is as much their fight as it is ours

4	at this time name will file as a member of arem  we intend to oppose the cpucs request for our contracts and transaction information

if you want any other info or want to discuss further let me know

name

how did this mistake happen  does their tariff allow for restatement of prices  does this cost the desk   maybe the nyiso shouldnt be doing this

probably better to have one payment this year and one payment on jan2 charged back to 2001

thanks

name
 

i still think that name should be advocating some form of negawatt program for nonretail access states  using an rtp tariff that more closely tracks the wholesale prices from an rto balancing energy market with locational signals can be used without any retail access and can have the load response needed to keep prices from skyrocketing  of course this would require a da market because the signals need to come in ahead of the usage

by the way i disagree that we need a wholesale rate for capacity  we should make sure that we put this in our comments on rto week

ive asked name name to try and develop through arem some form of legal action that the industry could file if the cpuc goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend da as of july 1

our goal should be to file tomorrow evening assuming cpuc action  to make sure that we are on board it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon 1pm pst  i will leave it to name name to arrange with the people on this email a conference call to discuss the draft

my choice would be to not have name file the paper but rather work through arem

thanks

name
 

are these papers consistent with names positions

namet worry  appreciate the thought  

name
 

please cover this

name
 

great  really appreciate

name
 

i know that sce is taking this position  they are simple wrong  unless and until we get all of our positive ctc back from the utility why should i even begin to consider their goofy arguments  in addition sce is receiving 33 b which is a full payment of all negative ctc  if their issue is to have a undercollection charge against all customers thats a different policy matter  the cpuc agreed to the idea of negative ctc and sce needs to pay  

also if we are 5 of load and the undercollection is 33 b i think that sce would be looking for 165 mm  our entire claim  they arent talking about 5 from our view 150 mm claim

name
 

name 

what is our current involvement in the urg case  do we have a range of potential outcomes for each udc

my thoughts
 
i would change the section reliability to operations  the current framework is nonstandardized  poor seams interface
 
under access to transmission i would change it to say that not all users on the system take service in a nondiscriminatory manner  utilities cant discriminate versus like users
 
under generation  i would change optional to optimal
 
i dont also understand the 99  easier to say 100     public power recipricoity issues
 
thanks

please examine closely the attached note from the calpx  in the letter
they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to
buyers or theyll simply decide  this is a quote 

d	allocation of refunds to demand buyers  as part of these
proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be
addressed  calpx proposes to use its sharefraction allocation method
to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there
are no specific commission orders on how to allocate the refunds

please let me know the implication and if the caiso has a similar
provision in its tariff

please let me know what else i need to do

name
 

name 

i was speaking yesterday with name name  he indicated that we continue to have or may have soon litigation surrounding our ownership interest in cornhusker  

this is important primarily because the texas public utility code requires that the puc approve any merger of generators that will have a combined ownership of over 1  which dynegy and name will have  

i want to make sure that we represent our ownership interest to the puc appropriately given the current dispute  if you have any specifics please let me know or give me a call

thanks

name
 

looks like we need to make sure that this nerc  rto policy dispute gets identified and recognized as what it is  discrimination

name
 

fyi  name you may want to be on this call

name
 

agree  would be good to have the utilities answer in graphic form 17 rtos versus fercs model on a sidebyside  discussion of the tca work on natural markets to support ferc

name
 

if you want to talk about the ky issues probably best to get with name migden

name
 

name   please review and discuss with me if you think there could be financial products placed on top of this utility service  ie could we get a customer to agree to this and then offer a swap to fix their rate

name
 

id say 395 is fair

name
 

name 

please let either name or name know if you need our assistance

name
 

after talking with name i intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning dec 3  

also just to make sure everyone is clear name name and name are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that ees andor epmi responds timely to any request for info additional security or other utility matters  this of course will continue to require help from legal credit and operations

if anyone has any other questions please give me a call

name
 

name 

i tried to call this morning  no answer  pls give me a call today

name
 

namet know where you guys are with the negotiations but here is another small issue with pge that would be nice to work through with them

name
 

in our discussion of the name model we dont outline when the cap would be set  would the name model give our traders certainty before the fact and certainty that no refund is due if we dont exceed  maybe make this point stronger

name
 

name  thane 

can we have a meeting this week maybe thursday at 330 to discuss this

name
 

randy 

dinner is at 745 pm at cashions eat place  1819 columbia  name is coming  call me on my cell phone at 7138512499 with any problems  name to see you there

name
 

i agree with name shelk to not attack the cbo report

while the cbo again and again relies upon academic studies to state that generators may have withheld power the basic argument is that deregulation itself not fail rather it was never acheived   in addition the paper states that much of the blame for californias electricity crisis attaches to the states restructuring plan  but not to its objective electricity deregulation

in addition californias response of directly intervening in the market  a response that could prove costly to electricity consumers and taxpayers

i hope that we can use this to persuade ferc that they are missing the boat on the refund case  the cbo has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the states poor plan and actions created the financial and political crisis  the cbo finds that wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated marketbecause features of the restructuring plan limited the responsiveness of the supply and demand sides of the electricity market

seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out together with our details of the policy failures  this cbo report clearly undercuts the political arguments of the name administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible longterm contracts but has passed through 100 of the high costs to consumers

name
 

namet we want the iso to provide to whom the refunds are entitled

name
 

let me know about how you intend to move forward  probably the same team as the ca reporting

also what did aga do with its storage figure report  i heard that they cancelled the publication
 
name
 

name 

the puct called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information  have they communicated with you about this

name
 

name 

some interesting language for the icap team  please forward along

name
 

this is especially problematic given that ees and ena can not comply with the reqts as defined

name
 

yes but i think we may lose that rating  what is the impact if that were to occur  seems like we should a identify our situation given todays environment and b identify the impact of one further downgrade

name
 

name 

im guessing that name andor name have responded  the short answer is that there are going to be a number of legal tests before we are completely in the clear

name
 

name 

i thought that name set up a daily call regarding the ca and pacific northwest refund litigation at ferc  its not on my calendar  can you please call name hawkins to verify and put on my calendar

name
 

no  ill let her know if she asks

thanks
 

we also need to check reporting for post jan 1  name can you make sure that name fite knows this

name
 

great job name  lets keep up the pressure

name

name
 

name 

i will get with name and his team and pull this together  of course much of the activity with utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements which change over time

name
 

see last bill

name
 

looks good  why doesnt epsa propose a timeline for the ferc to order  this could be a signal that we only want one rule change date  also maybe we can build in names argument about uncertainty hurting liquidity and market dynamics right now

name
 

my only addition would be to strengthen the answer to 5  rtos even if formed do not explicity resolve the question of the native load exception  i think that this is critical to highlight if this issued is raised

name
 

how about 1pm friday afternoon  you on a plane

name
 

i am planning on calling in from home  do we have a list of issuesstates that we want epsa to focus on

if you send me your thoughts i think that we can send to epsa before the phone call

my list 

1	florida wholesale ewg wo ccn
2	az opposition to the aps  pinnacle west generation sale
3	continue pushing at state level for nox fairness in allocation to ipps
4	reinstate direct access in california

many epsa members led by name will fight against direct access  i wont push hard here

name

steffes name d
 

here are my thoughts  issues with the epsa paper

1	the epsa paper indicates the preferred option of the 5 models that ferc staff proposed  should epsa at least indicate that it stands ready to analyze other solutions that may be proposed  gives epsa an out of this recommendation if it proves later that fercs application of the delivered price test is unworkable

2	 i dont understand when epsa says our recommendation therefore entails a more stringent method of assessing market power on page 2 of the draft  why should epsa indicate that it is comfortable with a 20 economic capacity test to ferc  i would argue that 35 is the minimum we should entertain as an opening position  also is there a fear that a power marketer would have to meet this test in realtime  having a once and done for three year application is ok but if we are conditioned that we cant get beyond 20 in any market what does this do to trading and how would this be reported

3	  the discussion on available economic capacity and its implication for having a bias against new entry is confusing  maybe we should clairfy our concerns  

4	the argument that all new generation is by definition procompetitive needs to be strengthened  it should be explained in the context of the delivered price test  also it that still true if a party which holds 100 mw in a 500 mw market builds a 100 mw power plant  now 200 mw in a 500 mw market  maybe i am missing something

5	epsa needs to make the argument that conditioning mbr on vague rules is wrong and anticompetitive earlier in the paper  this is my biggest concern  that we are perpetually subject to some refund risk when the market breaks even though our fundamental presence has not changed

6	i dont understand the epsa paper on rto versus nonrto markets  epsa endorses something but im not sure what  what does this mean if i sell on tvas network  i appreciate blanket authority but i wonder about exactly how this would be constructed  would this be similar to the natural gas marketer blanket authority  also doesnt this play into the hands of the transmission monopolists who dont want competition  if they never set up an rto they never face competition

name
 

name 

pls work through name and bevin name in name  my understanding is that puct filing deadlines are always 3pm but bevin can take it over to the puct this evening

name
 

good info  i like the reg orig plays  amr should track our success

name
 

here is the file  while there are some quotes remember that the analytics were never taken to the final decimal  we were mainly trying to make a political point

name
 

name etal  

attached is the complaint that ees intends to file tomorrow against sce related to the recoupment of our negative ctc  as you aware after returning our customers to da recently our billing department was expecting that the past negative ctcs would be returned to our customers accounts  this has not happened nor after conversations with sce will it occur  

this complaint is the next step in the process of attempting to recoup these funds  primarily ees does not want to pay for utility charges for our customers while an outstanding negative ctc balance is due

one key risk with filing this complaint is that sce may consolidate this case with the earlier complaint that is currently on hold  probably not too big of a downside

we will be paying the bills into the cpuc for holding until the resolution of the complaint

any questions or issues please let me know

name
 

yes if by aug 19 we dont have the strategy we should file  

but we need a comprehensive strategy before the end of the week  i hope to drive that to conclusion

name
 

please do not contact these customers 

fyi name signed the following customers after july 1 we are checking on walmart

i would like bev and hedy to rank these parties with their ability to help in sacramento with our messaging  once you have this lets talk this afternoon to plan going forward

as you can see from the email we are going to have to work through our business people

name 

whats the gas delivery tariff on cge for generation services  do they have a standard service  do they have a good generator interconnect agreement on the power side

name
 

before we take this on lets talk about how it fits into our priorities  what will be happening that we must cover

name
 

name   ill put in a call to discuss with them the contact point

name
 

a couple questions 

1	could the company include distribution wires as well instead of being just a transmission only wires
2	how many shares would a divesting company get  could this be more that 5  if so wouldnt this be over the control threshold

in general i fully support this type of action 

name
 

name 

ive asked the outside consultants to give us a  change for the impact of the refund case  try to give these to you asap  name alvarez will you please follow up with cra and jan acton

thanks

name
 

my thoughts 

1	focus more on tariff standardization i think that this is the key issue for name because lmp based bid balancing market is almost a done deal  and the texas market seems to be fine for liquidity  build around a new proforma with a network plus model
2	i would highlight that size matters  redouble our arguments and documents on natural markets in this filing as attachments
3	i would highlight the importance of ending the control area benefits and also strengthen the arguments for no sourcesink requirement
4	the gas  power industries are different not because the amount of vertical integration ie cng but because of the geographic reach  many ldcs used columbia pl but only one ldc uses aeps  the electric market needs transmission to be rationalized across the marketplace so moving power to where its needed from where its at
5	should we attack the 209 boards  agree that they are unnecessary but pls be careful

thanks

name

name yeung should pick up coverage for the flowbased discussions  name will not attend the next meeting in chicago that takes place on aug 30

got your note  its a little premature to forecast now  we will have a better idea by april 15  our timeline for completing our look at a revenue model  can we delay until then  we do have a monthly fee of 16000 that we are receiving from bridgeline that while small you could include in our revenue line to date  i am not sure why it is not showing up as income  probably because we have been considered a cost center to date  i suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers  by copy of this memo to name heinrich could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue  since our costs are fully allocated to business units this should be pure margin  hey you have to start somewhere  

i have a lunch meeting scheduled with name piper on friday this week one of the items that i want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business  i dont have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units  next week i can give you more info on that
 

yes these functions are covered in the netco list put together by name   under the tab labeled documentation in the electronic list sent to me by name fitzpatrick there are certain employees whose job titles include the phrase global management  meaning global databases including counterparty  name hare is on the netco list and is the most knowledgeable person in the company regarding the global counterparty database  contract administration for gas and power has been handled by name theriots group and name has accounted for that activity in her listing of employees for netco  name

operator error  i misspelled your name  probably too late to include  sorry i didnt see the failed delivery attempt until today  been kind of hectic at name  name
 

name perlman has fleshed out an idea for maximizing value for creditors of the name estate that i believe has a lot of merit  as you may know one of our business goals within name net works in 2001 was to commercialize mid and back office services  with the money and talent that has been poured into names trading operations systems and processes we believed that there could be market demand for these services  ironically enough we had secured our first services customer and were to begin providing these services on december 1  understandably the customer became concerned during november and the deal was shelved  our experience was that there was much interest in mid and back office services coupling our systems and our people but that the major drawback in the marketplace was that it was indeed name that was offering these services  the market place didnt want us to win again as name 

obviously the world has changed  while effort is currently focused on the formation of netco and how to realize value from remaining contracts within egm eim ea ees etc i think that we would shortchange the estate if we did not bring the idea of a services company to at least the proposal stage in order to evaluate its potential value for the estate  the idea would be to form this services company with a consulting firm which could provide some capital additional resource pool and a ready sales channel  with the potential of spinoff companies from name and with former name employees taking jobs with other firms many doors would be opened for this independent services company to provide services  servicing the name estate could be the first engagement for this services company  depending upon the structure of the deal benefits to the name estate could be reduced costs for systems and services perhaps a cash inflow from the purchase of the commoditylogic tools  the possibility of some revenue stream from other services engagements etc  another important aspect of this idea is that for the systems and operations professionals this would create a true career opportunity  a service bureau offering through an established consulting firm  making it much more likely that these people could be retained 

name and i met with a consulting firm today to explore the concept  there is definite interest so we discussed the idea with name piper today  we asked him for clarification around the netco agreement regarding systems and i believe that he has copied you on a note to name koehler regarding this  our ability to process transactions is one of names assets and our hope would  be that we are not limiting the full realization of value around that asset in the way that the netco agreement has been drafted 

the next step would be to have the consulting firm conduct a short due diligence process so that a proposal could be presented for the estates consideration  name and i would like to move forward with the proposal stage  it would be helpful to know your view on the process which would have to be followed to consider the proposal  if we as name felt that there is merit to the proposal would there simply be an approval process with the creditors committee and the court  would there have to be some sort of open bidding process on the proposal  to set expectations within the consulting firm it would be good to be able to give them a feel for the process 

your thoughts on this idea in general would be welcomed as well  name
 

thanks for your note  i really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner  i am so glad to hear that you will be joining us at name this summer  i know that you will find it to be an exciting place  please let me know what your start date will be  i would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you arrive  i hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at name  name

thanks  sorry we had to cut one hour down to 15 minutes  lots of time on budgets  still continuing this week  what i would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the doorstep team within a few days of their return from each review  my goal is to stay informed on an ongoing basis not quarterly or by bunching several of these together  if there are some concerns i need to know right away  executive management will assume that i am staying informed on a timely basis and that should be the reality  the is dont have to be dotted nor the ts crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting  it is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped will engage in a conversation with me  i want to be prepared so that i am knowledgeable about the key points from each review so that i can respond appropriately   thanks name
 

name would be good and i do believe that he is an asset  i will talk with name and see what we can suggest 

with regard to your comment that i am in in my conversation with name whalley a couple of weeks ago he said that he does need me to accomplish some things for the estate and that like name haedicke and perhaps himself there could be some issues with the estate and creditors committee if we were to go to netco immediately  what i agreed to with name is that i will be focused on the estate and that i would be interested in talking about netco in 30 to 60 days  in the meantime i will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction  i will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes systems staff expertise and operational controls  and you can also count on me if i can play a role in assuring that the staff destined for netco is in tact and is motivated and excited about the opportunities there  

name reeves will be getting the org charts to name this afternoon before she leaves  gas logistics is not included in the operations org charts as our understanding is that logistics is being included in the commerical org charts

thanks for your note  i have sent a message to name apollo who is name supervisor  name is out for the next two days and will return to the office on wednesday  i will make sure that name and name make a point of talking with you about this opportunity  name
 

in rereading this i noticed that name hall was included in the distribution list  he is the only one from names team included  do you want to copy name as well or was names inclusion due to his previous responsibility over the mpr which now is managed by name ayala  either way you may want to include name on the message just so that he and his team know about the creation of this common drive  

what about georgeanne hodges  should she be notified as well  you may also want to copy name as an fyi  thanks
 

the deadline has been extended by hr until tuesday so that many of us can work on these reviews over the weekend  you should see more responses early next week  name
 

thanks for your note and resume  i have sent a copy to our managing director of global financial trading  he is in our london office this week with a pretty demanding schedule so it may be early next week before i hear back from him with regard to his interest  i look forward to talking with you tomorrow  best time to reach me would be around 200 pm  name
 

thanks for copying me on name browns note  name herod flew to london last night and should be in the london office today  i am sure that she will be spending some time with you on this  she and i visited briefly yesterday about an effective model for support in london for the pulp and paper effort  so as to not steal her thunder it will suffice to say that i am comfortable that the two of you can hit upon a good solution and that it will feel much more cooperative than the existing egm model  name
 

name and team had preset the meeting schedule and topics to be covered in each  the outline that i sent you with the changes for the remainder of this week is simply our best attempt at fitting coordinating topics around people availability and the meeting schedule that had already been set  the schedule that we have been working with that name provided did not allocate two hours for the friday meeting  if you had set aside two hours that had not been communicated to us  there were only two onehour meeting slots on that schedule  one for enw from 12 and one for research from 34  i have a major conflict on friday  i committed months ago to attend a meeting that name lay asked to be involved in that is in the woodlands that runs through the evening hours  only because name perlman is out on thursday for a religious holiday i decided to skip out from this meeting to be here on friday afternoon to discuss the operations and it development budgets together  in order to minimize my time away from the woodlands meeting i orchestrated the time swap with name kaminiski so that we could have our enw meeting at 300  i will talk with you later today and fill you in on the commitment for name lay  maybe we can work together for a scheduling solution that works for both of us  i would appreciate your help on that name

scheduling issues aside name suggested that we also review with you the ees budget that enw has prepared  our approach so far has been to determine the appropriate and necessary spend for 2002 for expense and capital for all of the services that enw provides to support the ees business  we have done this without regard to who will cover which expenses  ees or ea  that is a separate issue from understanding the services that need to be provided and our best estimate at costs  we are prepared however with a suggested split on the costs for discussion purposes  i have assumed that the decision on cost sharing or allocation would be made between the offices of the chair for ees and enw  if you would like to cover all of enws budgets together both for ees and ea then it would make more sense to set a longer block of time maybe 3 hours  i will bring my schedule to our meeting at 1100 today to cover the canadian budget and we can work out a schedule that works for both of us 

we will be prepared to discuss pricing per transaction but will hold that until the end of our meetings when we have been able to review with you the components of costs and the detail of capital projects  our review of costs and projects in effect will serve as our scope of engagement discussion  a service provider would never quote a firm price until agreement had been reached on the scope of the engagement  we will have a straw man for discussion on that    name
 

i have left name a message about the email  no response yet  name call name name and name as soon as i finish breakfast
 

name 

thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk  we will certainly name an appropriate person from operations to be involved in this project and will work with you to help in achieving your objectives  there doesnt appear to be anyone from ets on your distribution list  operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of names businesses  is the initial focus simply on the wholesale businesses or is there an intent to make this enterprisewide 

i suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list to have a context for the way in which you see this rac initiative complementing replacing overlapping or perhaps duplicating the work of eas aas internal audit engagement the critical self assessment process being piloted in london this year by the operations team in conjuction with the aa audits doorstep reviews current operational risk reporting done by the various operations teams and our major initiatives for ees tracked every other thursday with you and name causey   before we each choose our appropriate representatives from our respective areas it might be constructive to cover this in a kickoff meeting with the addressees on your memo 

i might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilities at the beginning of this project  the creation of a framework for quantifying enterprisewide operational risk is perhaps different from the implementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit levels  as on other policies devised by rac it would seem that implementation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the tobedeveloped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business unitfunctional area outside rac  the crossfunctional team that will be formed is probably best used to give input to rac in creating the policy but may not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiatives 

finally the second bullet point in names list below is already being addressed through the project that you and i agreed upon in august to insure that information from all source systems to risktrac is complete accurate and efficiently handled as you and i discussed this is a global effort spanning all commoditiesall locationsall source systems   we have formed a steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closely with name brackett in defining the scope approach key milestones resource requirements and projected timeline project greenlight  a team of stakeholders from operations it and name brackett will meet tomorrow in order to review the project plan with name port and name name for final input  my assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for name and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed plan and timeline   assuming that you are comfortable with project greenlight when we review the details with you  i think that it would be appropriate to take this item off of the names list  we can certainly update the crossfunctional team on efforts underway but there is no need for a new team to focus on this bullet point 

name
 

fbi agents have parked in my reserved parking spot in the new name garage wednesday through friday this week 450  the spot is clearly marked reserved and as you know it is money out of my pocket for that reserved space   i have left a polite note on the intruding car on thursday and friday asking that the reserved status be observed as there are many unused nonreserved parking spaces in the garage  

i have put up with this for 3 days  if the fbi will be back here next week however i will grow tired of this  is there some way to communicate with them so that they observe the reserved parking spaces  

i know that you have bigger issues at hand but my concern is that if their visits to the building are extended that i will be paying for a reserved parking space that i never get to use

i realize that the timing of the name net works all employee meeting last friday made it difficult for the gas logistics team to attend  for future allemployee events within enw we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees  i didnt want you to be left out in this case so i have worked with name superty to set up another meeting for the logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last friday  i hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting  we have two videos that were made for the allemployee meeting that i think you will enjoy seeing  we will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers

after ees budget prep meeting this afternoon next tall order of business is expanding our receivables monetization beyond ea to other commodities  high priorty and very short time fuse on this one for reasons that should be obvious  i will have all of the operations leads and settlements leads together this afternoon along with ramesh rao and others in it who may be required to help us extract necessary info 

nice way of telling you name that i understand your desire for a page of footnotes with budget explanations for whalley and that in my opinion that falls at the end of the list behind some of these other things today  i will work with kerry on this  i can tell you however that updates on budgets are not top on anyones lists today including whalleys  we will honor your commitment to get him updated information and will provide as much detail as possible  best approach given the state of business today may be to provide him with the high level overview that one page of expense and capital state where we are in the review process with each business unit and highlight reductions in expense and capital to date   we can continue to provide updates to whalley as the ees eim egm and ebs yes i need to coordinate with name p when he is back on some changes here  confidential at this point  namet know how useful detailed footnotes will be for whalley before we truly finalize the various business unit budgets  name

i got the email last night with the tabs for the breakdown of the current 184 for operations inclusive of power and gas logistics  the tabs total 184 with one associate noted on a separate line in power logistics and 183 without that associate so i dont know whether you are using 183 or 184 currently for the operations total taking this number to 100 in total is obviously a big change  456 reduction  at this moment i dont know how feasible that is  but i will work with name name and name to find out
 
we  need some questions answered first to go through this
 
1  who is coordinating the look at headcount reductions for gas and power logistics  together those groups represent 25 of the 184 headcount  going in i would asssume that they would take their proportionate share of reductions  should be 21 reductions  we need to know who we should work with to coordinate this  need names and weekend contact numbers
 
2  what will the overall headcount be for netco  what we need to know is how many gas and power traders there will be and whether or not their anticipated business scope changes  if commercial numbers dont change and the business scope doesnt change a 456 reduction is probably out of the question  
 
3  is the 100 number for operations only a startup number  could we anticipate adding staff as business ramps up approval is obtained for physical gas business etc  or is the 100 number intended to be the total headcount for all of 2002
 
4  what are ubs expectations for mid and back office  what are the views from legal and ubs on creating confirmations for eol transactions  there were some discussions with name reeves about not confirming certain types of transactions  one firm and i dont remember whether it was ubs or not mentioned that we might not be the confirming agent on transactions and that instead we would review third party paper prepared for confirmations  that is a completely different activity than we normally engage in and would make a difference in staffing  perhaps requiring more people   we need to know those things from ubs to take a real stab at a revised number  should we just pool our knowledge from various discussions that have been had with ubs or is there someone with ubs that we should be talking with this weekend to get there view of what is required
 
5  does the internal rac group go forward under a headcount reduction  ie will we be coordinating and providing information to them or will ubs assume some of their functions  this may impact our staffing needs  what about consolidated risk reporting  will name and name simply transmit data to ubs or netco have to provide some consolidated risk reporting before sending info to ubs
 
we may have more questions but these are key now to get at a feasible number

per my voice mail name is still the lead on this initiative  from our conversation in your office i had assumed that this would change  apparently has not to date  

name buy and i are scheduled to get together tomorrow for an hour  my intent had been to review operational risk reports and information with him and to suggest an approach for meeting his objectives  he has added name name brackett name name and name port to the tomorrows meeting since our first point of discussion will be a joint project that name and i are sponsoring  unless he pairs down the group in tomorrows meeting after our first topic i doubt that we will be able to discuss follow up on our conversation in your office regarding operational risk  name
 

i am taking good friday as my discretionary holiday for the year  i will be in name with my daughter for her official tour and info session at ut plus a look at dorms  name will have numbers where i can be reached in name  

we are making final changes to the orig presentation today  i will be reviewing those tomorrow in name  i am emailing you a current draft version although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed  i am still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size  i have taken the work that rahil and name have done on the services and have made that into an appendix  nice work but way too much detail for a presentation
 

the past two years name has offered a very effective twoday session called executive influence and impact  this is required of everyone at the vp level and above and participation is definitely tracked  i thought that the class was very helpful  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participants leadership in communicating with and motivating employees  

name will now offer this course tailored for directors and senior directors   i would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity  unfortunately i didnt find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors  i want to work with the entire management team to create that plan as sessions will be offered in may september november and february 2002  

however today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session may 16 and 17  this will be given in name  i would like to have several participants from our team in this first session  my suggestion would be that name herod and name scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to shona name and thresa name as directors  i have asked name to secure four spots for us using these names as participants  if this timing does not work please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the may session  we would have to name a sub right away so please get back with me asap and confirm that the four names that i have suggested will be able to attend or let me know your recommendation on a substitution  
thanks

thanks so much for your note  i have assumed my new role as coo right at budget time so in addition to being on top of the budget for my operations team of about 1000 i have picked up responsibility for the other budgets under name net works another 2500 people that deliver our it infrastructure our system maintenance and development projects and our ecommerce platforms  the learning curve is steep right now but fun

your association with vanderbilt sounds interesting  cindy is keeping me abreast of your project  i sincerely hope that this proves to be a great fit for you  

while everyone in the country has been profoundly impacted by the terrorist attacks i can only imagine that the feeling is heightened for those of you that live in new york  my thoughts are with you and your family  name

this problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between gcp and rps and rgs  my understanding is that name taylor on your team is working on this interface  what is the expected completion of this interface and if is later than today what can be done to deliver this asap  with the large number of mass market deals being done it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem  can you call me today with an update  thanks name

good question  all cash outflows have an impact so it is probably best just to emphasize not spending unnecessary dollars  we have asked our direct reports to carefully consider travel is it really necessary and if so can only 1 person make the trip instead of earlier times when we might have sent two or three persons offsite meetings can an name conference room work just fine happy hours should get approved by name name or me ahead of time and we need to be comfortable with business purpose outside services and hiring  i think that you could share this with the assistants  

it is very important especially now to have updated contact information for employees  all assistants should make sure that cell and home phone numbers are uptodate  

please thank everyone for their focus and dedication during these tough times  i will let you know if i think of anything else regarding spending  name 

just thought of this  we should have all approvers within the ibuyit and ibuyitpayables systems look closely at and approve all purchases and payments  assistants in the past may have accessed requests on line for their bosses and automatically approved things to keep them going in the system  we should be actively reviewing and approving or disapproving all expenditures
 

all eight students that we interviewed for the name scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the mba program  i dont want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us  names letter noted below is a good idea but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year  i will find out who the recruiter is for ut mbas and i will get copies of the students resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter  name

our current plan on ea operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10  i will get with you on tuesday morning to review the names but i feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders  our current estimate on cost reductions for ea operations is less than the 54mm estimated 2 weeks ago

thought that my email message to you last week asked for a moratorium on contacting london re doorstep reviews until i circled back with you after conversations with buy and causey  sounds as if that moratorium either wasnt communicated or wasnt observed  

causey left me a voice mail message on sunday night saying he is okay with postponing all eel reviews at present  still waiting on buy  i will find him today
 

i got frustrated in trying to put together yesterdays lunch   our list of senior directors and above in net works seemed incomplete  i thought that name was a senior director and realized that his name was not on the list  i asked name to verify his title and to find out if he was in name this week so that he could be included  i didnt understand why he wasnt on the list  does he report to you  name that i didnt start a series of events that is wrong  i thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months  so i didnt understand why hrs records were not correct  name

i am going to miss the reception on sunday evening and interviews on monday  i will arrive on monday night and will interview on tuesday  look forward to seeing you then  name
 

name has close to 300 people reporting to him  the largest segment is the service management team  my understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers  we will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions  i dont think we are in danger of getting name back  name
 

realistically only the trading support provided for straightforward gas and power trading makes sense to consider in a cost per transaction mode  i would say that the only part of it development costs that could be considered in that would be the system maintenance costs and maybe the licensing fees  capital projects dont make sense on a cost per transaction basis  should be looked at as individual discreet costs that the business unit sponsor and enw agree upon 

while we could come up with a methodology for cost per transaction i still have concerns about this on a lot of levels  frankly the relationship between the book administrators and traders is just as collaborative as the eol relationship  if we are boxed into a cost per transaction then whenever name lavorato or the traders ask for a different view of data or an ad hoc analysis of pl we would need to discuss this as a change order and price accordingly  practically speaking there is not one of the ad hoc trader requests that isnt needed yesterday and stopping to negotiate whether the request is in or out of scope and additional pricing would probably get me and my risk team fired  i also have a big concern over pushing the envelope on an arms length service arrangement  i will have trouble recruiting and retaining the best people  the guys on my operations team honestly work every day with the business goals of ea in mind   they work hard to insure success for ea  that is what name and name should want  push us back too far and no one will like the results if we dont have people fully dedicated to and feeling a part of the business to which they provide support  it is kind of ironic  i think that name is pleased with how ive managed operations and one of my goals when i took the role a few years back was to create a true team between commerical and my operations team to make sure that this works for name  i have some really good people who are very motivated and a big part of that is my commitment to have operations viewed as an integral part of the team at ea egm eim etc  we had to work hard to achieve that but weve gotten there for the most part  so how odd it is to me that now some people want to undo what has been a major contributor to the success that we have had  ees is reeling right now partly because they have never recognized the value of creating a good operations team nor did they approach operations as an integral part of managing their business in full  and now i have been asked to help correct that  makes you kind of wonder

i am fully supportive of running operations and enw like a business with a critical eye toward delivering value effectively  when i first took this role i told my team that at that time we were the service provider of circumstance and that the goal was to move to a feeling that we were the service provider of choice  a component of this is definitely striving for lower costs and higher value delivered  we can continue to improve on this but going too far may produce the wrong answer for name  name
 

name is sending you my slides for the offsite  i finally got out of meetings long enough to review them

our meeting with eim is set for monday october 12th from 900 to 1030  name bowen has already reviewed the operations budget with name sweeney  name just initiated that meeting himself with name one day last week spur of the moment  but that is the only meeting regarding enw budgets that has taken place  i have been working with name castleman eims cao since last week to arrange our meeting now set for monday  

i think that by agreed plan mcmahon just means that is the amount that at this point eim is saying they are willing to take  name
 

this is a copy of the presentation that name superty made to the peoples energy board this week  lousie kitchen told me that he was very impressive in the presentation not a surprise to me but it is nice when others recognize the talent that is in the operations organization  we may be able to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal purposes and there may be parts of this that could be used in external marketing tools name
 

these are monday dates  with the original date being october 2 a tuesday i just wanted to double check the dates with you  unfortunately neither date works for me  i am taking the day off on the 8th  name has a school holiday and we will be in dallas for mustang monday at smu  the program there ends at 300 or 400 in the afternoon and we will have driven to  dallas so i cant make it work to be in name that evening  and on the 15th i have a monthly national name league meeting  as presidentelect i am trying to make all of the meetings  if it turns out that the intent was a tuesday night meeting the 9th or the 16th would work  16th being the best because we will be in name for interviews  name
 

since you are the lead i assume that you have an idea from name on what he is looking for  since name referenced enw i assume that we will include roles with regard to it development projects  do you think that he also wants to pick up definition of infrastructure roles as well  name
 

i worlked with name gosset name white and name hall today on their input for proposed promotions for operations  name cashion has the recommended names and salary increases  do you need anything else  description of their respoinsibilities rationale for promotion recommendation etc  let me know  

i mentioned to name that letters had been given to both name gossett and name superty in late november or december stating that they would be promoted from director to senior director at the first of the year  we have name covered but with the change in name supertys reporting relationship i want to be certain that his promotion doesnt fall through the cracks  name was somehow unaware of these letters although they were prepared by hr  as you review the entire list of proposed promotions please be check to make sure that name supertys name was submitted by name name for a promotion  

thanks  name

can you have someone send me the list that you said you have provided to suitors of the ena business  i havent seen it yet since we talked this morning  name hall and i thought that list would be the best one for us to reconcile to for reporting to you and name on resignations  since you have submitted that list we should also decide on a process for updating that with new names that we would substitute for someone who leaves  

since i havent received the list yet please send it to both name hall and me  i will be out of the office on thursday so name will handle the details of a daily report starting tomorrow  

thanks  name

sorry that we didnt get together today  i plan to be out of the office from now until  monday december 31  i will be in name through christmas and can be available by cell phone on thursday and friday this week december 20 and 21  i will be in new york for several days following christmas from december 26 through december 28

june 12 works well for me  it is likely that we will be on vacation on friday june 22  my husband is finalizing airline reservations today and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on friday june 22 rather than saturday june 23  name
 

can you update me today on status issues and resolution  we need to get back with name name today  name
 

i was at the preseasoner opener at name field last friday night and saw you throw the first pitch  it was a nice one  never a chance of it hitting the dirt  name
 

i am forwarding this message to you sent to me by name superty  name is the director of gas logistics for name americas and attended the lunch meeting that i held yesterday  i asked all in attendance to let me know if they had ideas on things that could be done to improve employee morale  i can always count on name to give thoughtful consideration to this type of request  here are his ideas  some of these i can orchestrate for my operations team and the broader name net works employee base  some of these suggestions could impact a broader base of employees  i would be happy to lead any or all of these efforts on an namewide basis is you think that would be appropriate  i could certainly use some help however  

you may already have a venue for this but maybe it would be a good idea to put together a small team of interested individuals like name superty who could make suggestions in the short run on ideas that could improve employee morale  not a formalized committee and not even one that would have to be announced or publicized  just an ad hoc group to make a difference now  maybe this doesnt have to be corporate wide  maybe each business unit could put together an ad hoc group if they feel that it is appropriate for their business unit and maybe these various ad hoc groups could just share ideas  this might be even more effective with buyin and initiative from the business units rather than the feel of a corporate overlay  as i am typing i am thinking that maybe we will pilot this in name net works and simply share what we are doing with others  

your thoughts  name
 

i will meet with name this afternoon on her comments on confirmlogic  bottom line no sign off from name at this point  thought you might want to know  name

another excellent player is shona name  she currently leads the group that produces the dpr and the mpr  she had excellent experience with pwc before joining name auditing trading companies in europe  i have some thoughts on the value that she could bring in working with a new owner of the business  she could be instrumental in blending our risk reporting process with another entity

i know you are both busy  lots of push back from london on doorstep reviews  i recognize that our world is pretty crazy right now  however it is londons normal stance to push back on the reviews and work to the change the timing  i think that they view being a subject of a doorstep review as an elective procedure on their part  

next week i will follow up with you to get your thoughts on doorstep efforts during the 4th quarter  wanted you to see my reply to fernley below  name
 

what is lily of the valley  i dont know  would it add anything special to the coursage  if so i would be glad to spring for it  i just dont know enough about flowers to make an educated call  could the florist tell you how wonderful it is for 60  

name and name often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate  maybe only key for the young set and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary white rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird  we will be upgrading dad from a carnation anyway  

you know in the end whatever you arrange will be terrific  i dont mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful  i am saving that in full force for later life  only kidding name

name do the best we can  as enw we utilize the analyst pool much more heavily than the associates pool  several of us from enw nterviewed analyst candidates for fastastic friday on october 26 including me  i believe that we have a number of enw managers committed to the november 16 fantastic friday interviews for analysts

i talked with name koehler in legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from energy operations prior to the effective sale of hpl  name believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term protocol into these discussions  to clarify according to name the protocol is not anticipated to be a formal legal document  instead name envisions simply emails or memos between name and aep with regard to any sharing of information agreements on processes to be followed in the transition etc  operational details to be decided between name and aep have been handled exactly in that manner to date with emails being sent from name ball name to name name aep  

only critical changes to the purchase and sale agreement will be formally documented  name hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original purchase and sale agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of may  he has worked with names treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with name braband in legal to document this change to the purchase and sale agreement as an amendment to that agreement   as of today legal has completed revisions to that amendment and name koehler is sending it to name perkins in names treasury group for her review  upon names review name will forward the amendment to aep for their review before final signatures  

we devised this week a new format for incorporating the aephpl transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you  this new format incorporates the various memos and emails which have to date captured the status of transition issues  items that only require actions by name will be our to do list  each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress  those items that fall under the aep list or which appear in both the name and aep list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to aep andor their agreement via the emails or memos as suggested by name koehler  i believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written protocol   we will also update you weekly on the status of those emails andor memos between ourselves and aep  

i understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the hpl sale  to provide clarity for these update meetings may i suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches 

	1  name and i hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that name has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status or 

	2 i attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you  

please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week
 

i have almost completely lost my voice today and am also running a fever  i have coordinated with name hall this morning and he will attend the 1000 meeting in ecn 30c1  he will be able to give a good overview of operations and will be able to coordinate any other information needs they may have  all that i could do at this point is cough and nod 
 
i could certainly answer any questions for the euros via email if needed over the weekend  call me at home 2813708568 and i will be glad to do so  
 
i do expect to be in the office on monday  hopefully with a voice  name
 

have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight  

these things need to be reviewed and possibly changed 


had perlmans total numbers from today which she did no subdivide into ea eim and egm numbers  made assumption that numbers from sundays spreadsheet for names egm and eim totals stood and backed into ea numbers by simply taking her total minus sundays egm and eim numbers  you will want to gut check this with name 

had names current total headcount 546 and her reductions to contractors and ftes  didnt have detail on her contractor versus fte numbers after reductions  just assumed 100 contractors remaining ftes  you will need to get that detail from name to correctly reflect her revised headcount  

there was a bust in numbers that i had for commodity logic development  gros gave me the starting number of 46 contractors and ftes  but without current breakdown  his reductions were 6 contractors and 8 ftes which should have left a revised total headcount of 32  but i wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group  off by 8 so i increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work  please go over details with name and make corrections as needed  

didnt have confirmed starting total headcount for isc  spreadsheet with his fte names gives a count of 129 so i assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179   name only reduced by 3 ftes and if he plans to reduce contractors i did not have that info  so all other numbers for the isc are simply forced  please review with name and make corrections as needed

let me know how the meeting with name and name went today  lavorato and i have been working on something regarding gas logistics and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 1030  the outcome of the meeting required a visit with name oxley so i could tell that making a meeting with you at 1100 probably wasnt going to happen  

how are your 500 pm meetings  

i will catch up tomorrow  name 


name that you made it to the soccer playoff game tonight
 

yes this was to be the review with corp  lay whalley and frevert  i am working with name lindsey on the revised schedule  still dont have one but i will let you know as soon as i know something  name
 

attached is list of questions  how soon could we have answers to these  i would appreciate any help that you could give me on this  name
 

your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of board positions held by vps and above  i thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list  beginning with a fiscal year that starts april 2001 i am now a member of the board and presidentelect of national name league a motherdaughter community volunteer organization 

we have over 300 members including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12 in the springchampions area  we run bingo games in local nursing homes provide coaching during practices for special olympics volleyball tennis track and bowling stock local food pantries work with children in afterschool programs in the local elementary schools etc  it is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves  the hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment
 

sounds good  i can be flexible  i will let name know to expect a call from your assistant on this  name
 

the list of proposed netco employees that name fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for weather and crude  do you contemplate that netco would trade those commoditiesproducts  name halls team that he has assembled for netco does not include anyone with either weather or crude operations experience  

we retained two topnotch operations individuals  name hall and name sweeney  who at this time are not on the list for netco  both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations  documentation risk books and settlements  name and name each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details

name has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for weather  prior to has role in egm name created the mpr and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio  he also has had extensive experience in gas risk management   

sweeneys most recent assignment has been to manage operations for eim  the bulk of his name experience has been in crude and crude products  he was part of the original team that opened the singapore trading office and has experience in the uk as well  

if you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power name and name would both be great players to have on the netco team  

lets discuss  name

name i know that we would like to get together with you to discuss ut recruiting  the easiest way to get this set up is probably for you to coordinate with our two assistants on a time that will work  my assistant is name thompson x39106 and names assistant is name westbrook   by copy of this note i will ask  name to coordinate with name and one of the two will get back with you to let you know available dates and times that name and i could get with you  name
 

please approve this request  name price is my direct report and is responsible for the rcs included in this request  thanks  name beck
 

mckinsey  i read their letter  pretty good recap of where we are today  name busby and i would like to meet with you regarding his assessment of market potential and internal tradeoffs relative to that  would make most sense for the three of us to do that before having any further conversations with mckinsey  what i know is that mckinsey can be very expensive to work with  we would have to feel revenue opportunities would be very strong in order to commit to spend dollars with mckinsey  


staff meeting attendees  name name sommers now attend the thursday net works staff meeting  does he know about it for this week  have we made any decisions on the purpose and makeup of that meeting  we are including names directs on it but not their counter parts in operations  including operations would make that meeting too big so i am not necessarily suggesting that  just trying to rationalize the meetings that we want to have  fyi  in causeys staff meeting today name mentioned that the move of the isc under net works was announced within net works  and spread  before causey or name announced this to the people in the isc  creates a bit of a bumpy start  causey is still very much in favor of this move  he did share with me last week 3 things that he will be looking for to insure that this move is smooth and yields the results desired  i can share those with you  causey has explicitly covered the 3 items with name in agreeing to the transition  

budgets  after meeting with whalley last week should we consider coming to the table as net works with a reduction in budgeted dollars expense and capital of 10 or so  that has not been our goal to date but maybe it should be given the stretch that name is trying to make  might also bode well with all of the business units to which we are allocating if we could say that we took a hard look and made those reductions ourselves  i have some ideas on how we might get there  let me know  we would need to get that done this week  name
 

name responded and filled me in on the issue  sounds like we need the automated link to solve future problems  how are we going to clean up the existing backlog  did you know that this had grown so large  name says that this sits in name stubbs lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help sounds as if the offer has not been taken by name  

name is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things  i hate getting these emails from him he always has more info than i do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me  i would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and i am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first  namet worry  you are not alone in this  applies to ea egm and eim as well  lets talk about how we can manage this better

to  all egm and eim employees affected
from name beck managing director of enwglobal risk management operations

last fall the name wholesale services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from name skilling  all wholesale companies name americas name europe name global markets and name industrial markets plus name net works and name global assets were included in the name wholesale services umbrella  in that organizational memo the energy operations team now global risk management operations was moved into name net works to align our operational services information technology and ecommerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to name wholesale customers  this alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well  with this reorganization we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses

since this reorganization occurred so close to year end i suggested that we wait until january 1 2001 to move employees under name net works  senior management accounting and hr agreed with this date for effecting the move to name networks  unfortunately however the january conversion to networks did not get fully executed  

to correct this effective april 01 2001 all egm and eim  employees  and nonemployees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to name price and name herod respectively will be transferred to enw  global risk management operations under  company 083e   starting april 1st you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes  this will formalize the enwglobal risk management operations structure

there are some direct effects that surround the conversion to name net works because you are transferring between name payroll companies irs requirements state that fica withholding must start over  this applies only to the oasdi 62 which has a maximum wage base withholding of 8040000 for 2001  medicare tax withholding of 145 has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual

the excess oasdi withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 2001 tax return as withholding  therefore to alleviate the burden of starting over you can adjust your federal income tax withholding down by filing a new form w4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess oasdi withholding  be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes  you may also contact the payroll department  7133455555 to assist you with any questions  

we will continue to have dedicated hr reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams  if you have questions please call the hr representative who supports your organization as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated  

business unit	hr contact	phone
egm 	name hill	7138534218
eim	name name	7133457803

thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of name wholesale services
 

sorry to cut the conversation short last night but frankly i was in tears and it didnt make sense to continue the conversation  certainly if you feel more comfortable staying at a hotel you should do what you think is best for you  we will just be happy to have you with us for whatever time you feel is right for you   my reaction last night was simply shock because we had never discussed your staying at a hotel during this visit  and your lead in to the conversation with you know we are staying at a hotel was such a surprise  yes you stayed at a hotel when you were here for thanksgiving but that was with name name brigeda name and name staying in our home as well  with just the two of you and since you had said nothing to the contrary i assumed that you would be in our home  

what you couldnt know of course is the caring time that i have taken over the last several weeks to complete a refresh of the guest room all with the timing based on having it ready for the two you for this weekend  but it was this special effort for your visit that made it particularly surprising and then disappointing to me that you will stay at a hotel  i had it down to the details of new hangers for the closet a real bed instead of just a frame i ironed sheets on sunday night something that i never do for us and have my framer on a tight turnaround on reframing some family pictures to complete a wall in the guest room  certainly other guests can enjoy these things too but my timing on everything was to make the room even more comfortable and complete for you by the time of your visit 

i have certainly gotten comfortable today with the idea that you will stay in the hotel and again whatever is best for you  sounds as if we should make that the norm from this point forward and then expectations will be set ahead of time for everyone  

i do hope that you can come in time for lunch on friday  i am planning to take the day off from work and the plan was that name would join us so that the four of us could have lunch at champions  name has taken some office space near champions and we had planned to show you that as well  then we can rest you can to do that at the hotel if that is better for you before having our nails done at 400  but again whatever works best for you  just let us know  name

my little guys arent so little any more  name is a senior this year  had all of her college applications submitted by november 1 and feels pretty good just knowing that her part is done  she has gotten one acceptance  university of oklahoma  she also applied to ut smu and tcu and is waiting to hear from them  she may hear from smu and tcu before christmas  ut probably after the first of the year  by the way name and i are strongly talking up the state school thing given the current name share price or diminished portion thereof  this senior year is going by all too quickly especially since the last month or so i seem to be hearing about it secondhand having spent way too many hours in the name building

and mentioning the building i moved to name center south the new building in mid september  im on the 4th floor  one of the trading floors  kinneman is on this floor too  kind of a cool building but weird because it is not really finished  our floor is fine but you have to walk through a maze of temporary walls on the second floor to get to the elevator  and some elevators are panelled with rough plywood inside   the sky ring thing is cool too but half of the circle is closed on a daily basis as they continue to finish out the space  we walk under open ceilings with wires hanging down  not exactly sure how we were able to swing an occupancy certificate but we are here  

do let me know if you are going to be in name anytime soon  i would love to get together with you  between 911 and our current cash constraints  my previously planned november london visit is not happening  

enjoy your thanksgiving in london  name

      this would be preferable but i dont understand what rules could be changed to alter the existing accounting treatment  also names numbers do not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project and id bet that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after the project was initially developed  the other thing to keep in mind is that there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow  we will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term market which is the only way to do high injectionhigh withdrawal storage to capture short term market anomalies  are you okay with that  i am

      the 2002 transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ena  currently those hedges are approximately 170m in the money  our ena hedges would certainly be rejected by a trustee in bankruptcy  since these were affiliate transactions i would assume that these positions were all layed off to a nonname counterparty  is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions  if not we could have a big hole for next year

now that we have all migrated to outlook please be sure to give everyone in the group access to view your calendar  you will need to grant permissions to all group members both in the outlook today box at the top of your folders list and in the calendar box 

1  right click on outlook today at the top of the folders list if your folders list is not visible click on view and then folder list
2  left click on properties at the bottom of the list that pops up
3  left  click on the permissions tab
4  add all of the swap group members as reviewers to give them read access

im still concerned about the terms price and quotation  my understanding was that worldscale is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price  that is what it looks like in the baltic exchange limited publication  i havent seen the iitra publication so cant comment on how their quotations are denominated  the problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description the floating price is defined to be the index  therefore the index must be a currency denominated number  that is why in the us version i used the average of the prices calculated using the worldscale assessments  do i have this all wrong

it really was unbelievable  our neighborhood usually doesnt have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain at one point they say it was 6 per hour was so high that it just couldnt drain away that fast  the water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage not high enough to get in the car covered the pool and completely surrounded the house  it looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in  just one more inch and id be in big trouble  luckily i slept through the whole thing  if id been awake i would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs  furniture to the second floor  a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside  the garage apt tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldnt start without being jumped  i got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear  no standing water anywhere  by the time i got up in the morning it was all gone

interstate 10 where it goes near our place say from downtown out to the loop looked like a river  the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges  i didnt see it myself but i hear that 59 was the same way where it dips down between montrose and shepherd  you missed a big one
 

fyi   

below is written by our environmental consultant eea


based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just 
released the allowance surplus for this year is 23189 tons 
bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83778 tons  this 
would mean a flow control value of 026 or a discount factor of 063 
for 2002  the exact flow controldiscount values cannot be 
calculated right now because they will depend on how many 
banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on 
the implementation of the maryland consent decree which the state 
and epa probably wont figure out until next year  but we are 
pretty much in that range

broadband networking news  name holmes 03272001  name hits back quickly after blockbuster failure namebased energy and communications conglomerate names name broadband services unit signed a deal with electronics boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertainondemand eod service  under the terms of the march 19 deal electronics boutique subsidiary ebworldcom will stream leading games for rental to name s broadband customers the deal is a positive development for name after the collapse of a deal with blockbuster which the companies announced march 9 that would have given name exclusive rights to deliver movies for a videoondemand service   the exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new ondemand service explains name d rice president and ceo of name broadband services  the blockbuster announcement was disappointing but i do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete notes name yannello a utilities equity analyst at ubs warburg i do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to endusers i would guess they need to do some more deals driving traffic on to their systems i think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the blockbuster deal i think the blow was more psychological and i would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company which is what they did  the failure of the blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20year agreement could have given name significant upside in the content delivery business   i dont see blockbuster as being a broadband killer for name  name christensen a utilities equity analyst at first albany corp tells broadband networking news i think they will probably get one or two anchor tenants before the year is out i am optimistic  the deal with electronics boutique and the failure of the deal with blockbuster emphasize the importance name is placing on securing content for its broadband network yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand this is name s core telecom business  the content deals while important are not being factored into most analysts forecasts on the company   i am confident that the content delivery business will be successful says name niles a utilities equity analyst at salomon smith name the fact of the matter is they did get another deal it was not as large as the blockbuster deal but they did get another one in there we are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery whether it is very successful or not very successful in our forecasts we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business i think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage  the reality is that no one had any earnings from blockbuster in the company projections for several years at best yannello adds it was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app it is disappointing but i do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals i also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in  name which produced revenues of over 101 billion in 2000 from its various businesses is still rated highly by analysts despite the failure of the blockbuster deal   we have a 100 target price and a strong buy rating yannello says that assumes roughly 75 of value for their energy business and 25 of value for their broadband services division i think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena and given that the blockbuster deal has falling apart i think we be will waiting a while before we expand that 25 telecom valuation

regarding the need for the rmt confirms i have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed  if that is not the case i dont object to doing away with them altogether

we have approved doing away with confirms for eol trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis  we havent actually gotten there with anyone yet having just started the actual discussions this week  our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate  initially we are only working on physical power physical natural gas and derivatives transactions other than weather  the idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered  this will obviously be a very timeconsuming and laborious process  the initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people  our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on texas and new york law analysis  if any canadian deals are at issue we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations

februarymarch 2001 issue  name unveils storage trades name broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market commoditising this fastgrowing area for the first time it acted as a market maker purchasing storage capacity from storagenetworks  which was then sold on to best buy a retailer of electronics products crucially both contracts were based on names standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages  in the last few years the storage market has moved from being a selfmanaged and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network names involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality according to ravi thuraisingham a senior trader at name when we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later that is unprecedented says thuraisingham   the storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market but these trades mark a significant development rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases there is a premium in the price for firm delivery says thuraisingham  he says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to name as a market maker in addition equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market this development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market says thuraisingham

attached are my projected balance for 2004 nox sip call  it is based on numbers from eea environment consultants epa website nox sip call model and new generation database  the confidence level for overall balance is not that high  the otr states only need to reduce 15 from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance  they have some scrs already built and the plans for the other scrs needed  the nonotr states are far more dirty than the otr states  the big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states  i believe that there will be a demand for allowances  i believe the nox sip call market to be a short at this point  people think it is worse than it really is

also i can make a price forecast  the confidence level would be low on the price forecast  what else do you want here

one of our proposed speaking topics is lng  a new role in north american supply a concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gasfired electric generation needs  the committee feels lng can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future

are you tired of all those mushy friendship poems
that always sound good but never actually come
close to reality
well here is a friendship poem that really speaks
to true friendship
friend
when you are sad i will get you drunk and help you
plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you
sad
when you are blue ill try to dislodge whatever is
choking you
when you smile ill know you finally got laid
when you are scared i will rag you about it every
chance i get
when you are worried i will tell you horrible
stories about how much worse it could be and to quit
whining
when you are confused i will use little words to
explain
when you are sick stay the hell away from me
until youre well again i dont want whatever you
have
when you fall i will point and laugh at your
clumsy ass
this is my oath i pledge til the end why you may
ask because youre my friend
send this poem to ten of your closest friends and get
depressed because you realize you only have 2 friends
and one of them is not speaking to you right now
anyway
remember a friend will help you move a really good
friend will help you move a body

hi everyone

	for those of you i havent met personnally my name is name hyatt  i am currently chairing the natural gas infrastructure subcommittee for the electric power conference 2002 to be held in march  you are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee  

attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each sessions speaking topics  the track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the trade fair group staff

i am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from calpine  what i need each of you to do is review the agenda think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic then call them to see if they are interested  speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a qa period afterward  

if possible please email or call me with your results by friday 1026  interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the trade fair group confirming their attendance    

thanks for your help  namet hesitate to call me 7138535559 or name shapiro 7134639595 x307 with any questions

name and name
	following up on our meeting today i need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our sun devil project  how much if any can i discount the fuel charges for sun devil shippers based on the following assumptions 

project cost 911mm
include all compression addsmods from name cebryk engineering scope dated 92801
incremental volume mmbtud 780000 san name 810000 mainline 500000 to phoenix 310000 to cal border
of 1520000 total capacity to cal border and 500000 to phoenix assume 390000 has to come from east of thoreau
assume load factors in 10 increments from 50 west flow up to 100
assume fuel collection of 5 from shippers

in theory we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for sun devil and the new compressors at stations 14 are more efficient then the actual fuel use should be less  please verify this for the load factors above  if we can keep the same net fuel retainage but collect less because our actual fuel use is less then this is a winwin for both tw and the sun devil shippers

is an answer possible by tuesday 1113

attached is the sun devil powerpoint presentation we gave to name back in december  i added one slide since called project rationale  the document probably has more detail than you need but more is better right  let me know if you need help cutting it down
 

a womens primer on men


 namet know if youve seen this or not



 to women everywhere from a man whos had enough

 you really want to figure us out  heres a start

 1  learn to work the toilet seat if its up put it down we need it up
 you need it down you dont hear us gripping about you leaving it down do
 you  no of course not  that would be stupid and there are far more
 important things to be worried about  you dont try to sit in the
drivers
 seat without opening the dammed car door do you

 2  if you wont dress like the names secret girls dont expect us
to
 act like soap opera guys

 3  if you think youre fat you probably are namet ask us its a stupid
 question and we refuse to answer

 4  namet cut your hair ever long hair is always more attractive than
 short hair  period  one of the big reasons guys fear getting married is
 that married women always cut their hair and by then youre stuck with
her

 5  birthdays valentines and anniversaries are not quests to see if we
can
 find the perfect present yet again

 6  heres a real easy one  if you ask a question you dont want an
answer
 to expect an answer you dont want to hear

 7  asking opinionated questions that you already have an answer to and
 then getting pissed off because we gave our honest answer in the opposite
 direction is a really stupid thing to do

 8  sometimes were not thinking about you live with it

 9  namet ask us what were thinking about unless you are prepared to
 discuss such topics as navel lint the shotgun formation or monster
trucks

 10  sunday  sports its like the full moon or the changing of the
tides
 let it be

 11  shopping is not a sport and no were never going to think of it
that
 way

 12  when we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine
 really

 13  you have enough clothes

 14  you have too many shoes

 15  crying is blackmail and you know it  knock it off

 16  lets be clear on this one  ask for what you want i repeat ask for
 what you want  subtle hints dont work strong hints dont work really
 obvious hints dont work just say it  no your having to ask for
something
 does not automatically make it not worth getting  if it did you might as
 well give back the car the house and that last raise you got  and no
 trying to punish us by acting like you dont want the thing 30 seconds
after
 you were compelled to ask for it will not teach us a lesson or jumpstart
 the esp gland within our underdeveloped craniums  heres the math write
it
 down somewhereask  getno ask  no get

 17  no we dont know what day it is we never will name anniversaries
on
 the calendar

 18  peeing standing up is more difficult were bound to miss sometimes

 19  most guys own three pairs of shoes what makes you think wed be any
 good at choosing which pair out of thirty would look good with your
dress

 20  whether or not you believe it yes and no are perfectly
acceptable
 answers to almost every question

 21  come to us with a problem if you want help solving it thats what we
 do  occasionally we can go out on a limb and attempt to empathize
 however be warned that approaching us with a problem without clearly
 indicating which you want solutions or empathy will likely result in you
 getting neither  tricky system but thats just the way it works

 22  sympathy is what your girlfriends are for

 23  a headache that lasts for 17 months is a medical problem see a
doctor

 24  foreign films are best left to foreigners unless its name lee or
 jackie chan where it doesnt really matter what theyre saying

 25  check your oil
 26  if we tell you that you look beautiful at 530 in the morning or any
 other time when you are dirty mussed up or otherwise not perfectly
 coiffed we really do mean it  telling us that we dont really pisses us
 off and further decreases the likelihood of your hearing anything of the
 sort when you are fishing for compliments

 27  it is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz
together

 28  no it doesnt matter which quiz

 29  anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument

 30  all comments become null and void after 7 days

 31  if something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways
 makes you sad or angry we meant the other one

 32  let us ogle stare were going to look anyway its genetic and we
 know you do it too

 33  you can either tell us to do something or tell us how to do
something
 but not both

 34  whenever possible please say whatever you have to say during
 commercials

 35  if it itches it will be scratched

 36  if we ask whats wrong and you say nothing we will act like
 nothings wrong  if we ask and you say that something is wrong we would
 greatly appreciate your helping us out by actually telling us what it
is
 before our aforementioned inability to read minds once again quickly takes
 the place of the actual issue at hand

 37  when we are with the guys or watching sports or both we are
bound
 to look say do or act stupid  it doesnt bother us  it shouldnt
bother
 you

 thank you for reading this yes i know i have to sleep on the couch
 tonight  we really dont mind that though its kind of like camping
and
 we get the remote all to ourselves

 sincerely
 the men

 

tw currently owns a section of pipe called the gomez lateral located south of tws west texas 2 compressor station  the lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20inch diameter pipeline

the gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas  per field operations personnel the last time the line was used was october 31 2000  

pioneer gas pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company  pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from tw for 2 million  current book value on the line is  

tw could file with ferc for abandonment of the pipe and sale under the existing blanket authority if
	1 no it gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or
	2 no ft shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months priorif an ft shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale


items to verify
 1 identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the gomez lateral
 2 determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale field ops is checking


opportunities for tw
by pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into tw  this would reduce the amount of gas necessary for tw to transport south of wt2 via displacement and make more supply available for deliveries going west

a lunch has been scheduled with name allard from pioneer on wednesday 220 if you would like to attend

name can you please run 2 cases to calculate a backhaul rate to phoenix using sun devil

case 2 same as above but load factors as follows

year 12		50
year 34		70
year 57		85
year 820	100

	im trying to rebuild my pc at home  the hard drive cratered on me  ive installed a new one but the only windows operating system i have is on a restore disk from compaq win95 and for some reason its giving me an image builder error when i try the restore  this may be due to the fact that i trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original

anyway i also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition  when i try to load this is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system which i dont have except on the restore disk which wont work

so my question is this do we have an old win98 operating system lying around i can borrow so i can load my win98 upgrade

	we are working up a proposal for aps in phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the projects ferc application ready  tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of 8750301  is this still a good number to use for our aps proposal  lets talk wed 123 if possible  

thanks
 

thanks blair weve been following the fr debate very closely

last week ferc staff recommended to the full commission that the fr contracts be converted to cd contracts in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the original 1996 el paso settlement  the indicated shippers last year did file a section 5 complaint against el paso accusing the pipeline of over selling its capacity  this debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in getting shippers to commit to the sun devil project
 

i had a conversation this morning with my contact at aps re the sun devil project  their 1 concern right now on the project is name creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline  

how do i get them comfortable
is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on tw  if so when
should we get name hayslett  name on the phone with their finance people

please advise asap so i can put an action plan together  thanks for the help

khyatt
 

i verified the numbers with name he did make the addition error  i also added the line for 
the red hawk lateral as a separate item  name had already run the economics using 843mm plus a 5 risk adjustment adder for the capex for a total of 885mm  i think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error

kh
 

name we estimate 4055 of the name sponsors have been severed this would translate to approx 200 kids  of these we have only needed to responsor 12 children but we wont know the final tally until friday afternoon

couldnt another explanation be that the board did understand the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the chinese walls and protections were put in place

i dont believe the board members would shirk their responsibilities as you pointed out most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals
 


10 things that can piss a person off 

1  people who point at their wrist while asking for the time  i know
where my watch is buddy  where the hell is yours  do i point at my
crotch when i ask where the bathroom is  i didnt think so

2  the pillsbury doughboy is way too happy considering that he doesnt
have a penis

3  people who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room
for the tv remote because they refuse to walk to the tv and change it
manually

4  when people say oh you just want to have your cake and eat it to
back off spanky  what good is a piece of cake if you cant eat it
what should i do  eat someone elses piece of cake instead

5  when people say its always the last place you look  no shit
sherlock  why the hell would you keep looking for it after youve already
found it  do people do this  who and where are they  why arent they in
treatment

6  when people say while watching a movie did you see that no i 
paid
750 to come to a theater and stare at the ceiling  what did you come
here for

7  people who ask can i ask you a question didnt really give me a
choice there did ya buddy

8  when something is new  improved  which is it  if its new then
there has never been anything before it  if its an improvement then
there must have been something before it

9  when a cop pulls you over and then asks if you know how fast you were
going  stop pulling people over and expecting them to do your job  its
not my fault you cant figure out the radar

and heres the tenth thing that really can drive a person nuts 

10  chain letters  who the hell thinks that by annoying other people 
with
stupid mail with no meaning that you will be granted a wish or make your
longlost love fall into your arms or have your significant  other 
perform
sex on demand  its all bull  im so sure that by breaking a stupid 
chain
letter that the computer gods are going to curse me  oh the terror and
horror  what a crock

by the way if you send this to ten people shit wont happen and that
person youre in love with wont come crawling to you  so if you feel 
this
is funny go on and send it to someone else but dont expect one thing in
return





                                                                 intlasp

following up on our conversation re red lake storage

assuming only a phoenix lateral gets built off tw no mainline or sj expansion
	capital cost is estimated at 304mm

a fully subscribed rate on volume of 750000d to get a 15 ror would be 152mmbtu with zero fuel retention

if we assume a more gradual volume ramping up beginning with 50 load factor in year 1 climbing to 100 in year 8 the target transport rate would need to be 248 closer to my top of the head 30 we discussed yesterday

both of these scenarios assume 8020 debtequity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 13 of the capital cost

also
regarding the kern name expansion what might the likelihood be of mojave receiving kern gas and backhauling to tw for delivery into aquila red lake  if the kern volume of 700000 out of 900000 capacity doesnt go to calif endusers i think mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from cal border to the kern interconnect  we could then take this gas and haul it to phoenix  

let me know what you think
kh
 

name
	per our conversation this morning attached is the original project open season announcement from august 2001  a couple of current changes are

volume to phoenix market  750000 mmbtud
volume to cal border       30000
san name receipts		  780000

projected rate to phoenix  045mmbtu

we are also offering 16 hour peaking capability max daily quantity available in 16 hours not 24
and pressure guarantees to those ft customers directly connected to the system which doesnt help bowie but may help you somewhere else

please dont hesitate to call me with any questions

best regards
 

spoke with name morgan  at this point he only has mon  tues 11415 open  he may have other openings if there are cancellations we just have to let him know so he can call us  the rut just started theyve taken some bucks off the place  if we wanted to hunt an extra day because we were there before he would charge 150 per shooter  if you wanted to bring a 3rd party price would be the full 500 for a 2 day hunt

let me know what you want to do  im flexible
 

i saw this too  is this just more stumping by concerned politicians in a congressional election year  i cant remember what party name is with  is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an open mic bitch session  id pass and read the results in the paper media is invited or the web site


i forgot to mention that todays curves will be down another 5 therefore the prices in the spreadsheet are too high
 

your summary is accurate   i appreciate you and name coming to name for the debriefing and we look forward to extending our exclusive relationship

thanks
 

i would recommend sitting with the realtime traders they trade reserve transmission and schedule the power in realtime   you can coordinate with me
 

no development is easy   i see nothing on your list that cannot be overcome   please develop a plan to have a 150 mw online my may 02 with rented diesel equipment   we would install the diesels at oppd distribution substations   we may have to do 15 different installations to acheive the desired result

last year comname and ipl completed an installation with cats in 3 months   the key is to get oppd to cooperate with interconnections at the distribution substations and we will get credit for losses

please work with name and name   if you need any additional info after working through a plan with name and name please let me know
 

name dorbone sp   you can get his phone  on gleannochfarmscom web site   they have 4 custom builders name bailey pine oak country village and name hale   they recently fired coventry and name name

i have not made a decision yet but i am considering gleannloch as an alternative   it would be a big positive for me if you could build the house
 

the first report looked good however i would like to see the owner name and technical configuration   in addition i would like pictures of each facility
 

friday is a terrible day for tours in power   my entire desk leaves at 200 pm on friday

i would suggest the gas floor for this tour   the customer will be very unimpressed if we have limited staff here in the middle of the day
 

for 01 and 02 congestionenergy uplifttransmission uplift is 350 to 450mwh   current ees curves are light in this area

for 03  beyond when lmp is adopted in ne iso and socialized allocation is eliminated the congestion component alone in the boston area will be well over 10mwh based on actual congestion s from may 99 to date in the boston area

much like the dallas situation these locational congestion charges can be significant and name and name will begin immediately developing delivered energy pricing curves for specific locations that go well beyond the wholesale pricing points we mark right now

i hope this helps
 

name and i are dividing up name postions name taking peak im taking offpeak   to make it fair on everyone i am allowing name to take 4 million from prudency c attached to jea  name has created this positive balance himself over the past 12 months with deals he has done in fl  soco

in addition i will be assuming all customer deals vepco jea associated mpmuc

we will mark the curves in entergy and tva where name is comfortable taking the position offpeak also needs to be marked down  the 4 million from prudency will absorb most of the curve shift   all of name postions will stay in wholesale

all parties come out with a fair solution
 

sounds good   we may want to consider diesel installation for name electric as well

i am beginning to think that diesel installations is our primary solution to cover oppd short for mayoct 02
 

icap exposure needs to be capped at the default price currently 875kwmo   because zone j is deficient capacity the market is actually trading higher than the default rate

in addition we need to scrub the ancillary components
 

i think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically   in order to grow this business we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and costeffective manner   the quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers
 

we have this already by comparing daily reports   i simply look at the change in daily postions   both lavo and i are ok with the current reports
 

we need to add name name and 45 people with td tariff knowledge to the curve team as well   this process will entail specific wholesale curves plus a complete review of the td tariff curves

these teams need to work together to ensure the sum of the parts equal the whole   i am assuming everyone on the team agrees
 

this is the spread option which i am able to reconcile   the big pl discrepancy is on the pure tve fixed price positions which are off by 1 million   please continue to reconcile with name name

thanks
 

is this going to get done   my sense is this would reduces energy uplift charges and reduce energy clearing prices   do you agree
 

as i told name this morning we have similar issues with var in the east   the correlations between gas  power for the entire curve are based on the front month and the correlations between regions are also based on the front month

i have requested changes to the var calc several months back and have been assured it will be completed by the research group soon
 

good info on new plants

name  can we get this spreadsheet on our website under fundies tab

thanks
 

we have a  of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading andor balance of month trading with no forward trading  it would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within eol that allowed for better credit screening   we have moved away from the broker markets and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties

i would like to get this changed asap if possible

thanks
 

we have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor   i think its important to put all power related retail functions risk management tariffs structuring risk reporting etc on the 5th floor

if you do this then there will not be room for the retail gas group which means you need to work with name shephard and name colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas
 

joe is set to rotate to realtime mw on june 1 and name rust is taking his scheduling place   i have no problem with joe going with you   with respect to narsima timing may be an issue transition however i should be able to make that happen as well

with busby name joe and narsima timing an issue you have some competent support at the outset   in addition there is almost certainly some capable people within the 200 person existing organization that have had no management direction and no discipline

hopefully the dust settles and the transition can start next monday   we also need to figure out what we do with your existing positions
 

i didnt receive any home information   im interested in resale homes new homes and lots

thanks
 

im not in the business of providing firm pricing via email   as always all prices from the desk are indicative until customer is ready to pull the trigger   as a rule of thumb prices are good for about 15 minutes

therefore lets be clear with the counterparty that we are in a volatile energy market with pricing moving 510 on some days   for example summer power is down 2000mwh over the past week and june is down 10mwh   name 02 and summer 03 are down 78mwh over the past 3 days

thanks
 

please begin working on filling our associated short position in 02   i would like to take this risk off the books

in addition please find out what a buyout of vepco would cost us   with name transitioning to run our retail risk management i would like to clean up our customer positions

we also need to continue to explore a jea buyout

thanks
 

we would like to hire name phillips from koch   name dana  i have all interviewed him and think he is a cant miss candidate   the bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter the fee is 20 of first year package

this guy is quality and i want to make an offer   please let me know if i can proceed asap
 

after talking with name it sounds like a conference call at 100 pm tommorow would be more productive   name and name are still working through logistics of the move to the 6th floor and solidifying some of personnel issues

does 100 pm tommorow work for you   we can call you from my office
 

yes i agree   remember name has asked to go through a deal and this is a significant transaction   i suggest going through the deal over lunch
 

ground pictures from various angles will do   my expectation is that i will continue to get weekly updates and the booklet i described will contain the info i requested in an organized manner

thanks
 

remember our deal   after trading day is over for next 2 months you stay until the risk calcs are done and help in whatever manner is necessary to improve the process   in addition you should take responsibility for calcing the ercot books term and cash
 

sounds good   i think we will significant synergy benefits immediately   the cultural barriers will be broken down and information will flow from wholesale to retail and vice versa
 

i already read this article   price action is wicked bearish on our stock right now   fortunately i have been doing a good bit of hedging my long name position
 

sounds interesting  clearly we would pay a some premium on the front end for the boston location   work directly with dana on the specifics
 

if you dont get a response from name just call her or walk up to the legal floor   on something as important as this i would go directly to names office
 

have you spoke to name whalley about name albrecht dierdra mccaffery name brysch and name kendall   we need to move forward on putting these teams together and the above individuals were key candidates indentified to rebuild the retail risk management organization over the next 69 months

i would like to hear back today on how we plan on proceeding with these individuals

thanks
 

name should be an associate trading track position   i forgot to clarify with name on original offer   remember we have to go through name johnson at name energy 

i would like to get the offer letter out today
 

i submitted my request to name melodick approx 1 week ago   

name  please make sure lavo and name have my wish list for analyst and associate candidates
 

i think i could make a case for decreasing ecp because some of the uplift actually sneaks into the ecp must run units for 6 hours etc   i would argue that the pool will dispatch more competitively when generators know that a peaker can run for 30 minutes at 100mwh   this forces baseload units to offer very competitive pricing for all hours to ensure dispatch

we have seen what the additional peakers in the east does to volatility and energy clearing prices in general

what are your thoughts
 

the only way the coal deal will go forward is if you prove you can get long term supply pet coke prb other etc for 100115mmbtu delivered to the site   the economics need to show a 810 irr in order to justify the commodity risk

in addition we should explore igcc in florida   the gascoal spread is much larger in this market and the proforma economics would be much better
 

name will do a fine job with this group presentation   i think it is important that name builds credibility with the marketing organization

im sure you are ok with this
 

when do the guys that signed contracts get the paperwork for option grants and restricted stock   they are all asking me
 

the mtm amount needs to be gross margin not revenues   what deal was done for summer cinergy on friday   did name sign off on all of the beco deals
 

i had to leave early yesterday so i am just getting around to reviewing   looks good   i will call with any comments

thanks name
 

name name name hernandez and name baughman plus kayne coulter should be the east power reps at this meeting
 

i talked with name hickerson and i am ok with granting name cisneros access for her specific valuation purpose pricing access is for 2 years only
 

great trading asset but fixed costs are enormous   the entire value proposition is based upon 15mwh spread between peak and offpeak which is clearly there today    my view is this spread collapses over time due to dsmdgrealtime pricing and true hourly price signals in pool based markets

we should look at the asset but recognize the fixed costs are huge
 

yes it is irrelevant   now that we have competent risk managers making the decision they will know how to effectively hedge these deals   furthermore pricing is always available on demand   when each trader has 3040 products to manage in a volatile market they are not necessarily going to put 0310 for peak and offpeak in every region

it becomes very cumbersome to manage the year over year spreads when the front is moving so violently
 

yes you are correct   name is making the changes i requested and we probably have at least another 2 weeks before i get a final plan

with respect to your latest contract i have 2 minor changes  the only one with any significance is the counterparty name   i expect namecarroll custom homes to be the signator to this agreement   having a shell llc entiity sign the contract would be like me having my stepson sign the contract

i want the real balance sheet to be on the hook for meeting the contractual obligations much like you want my personal balance sheetincome statement to be the responsible financial counterparty

the other change was wording and does not effect the contract intent

talk to you soon
 

your perception is correct   remember 4 years of culture is at work here   i told name this morning we have to move to 35 clearly define the process for pricing deals and begin changing the mindset of the marketing organization with respect to value

the whole situation on 6 is considerably worse than i originally thought
 

i would like to acknowledge name portz for his hard work and diligence in drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the green mountain power allrequirements transaction in ercot   name worked long hours ensuring all tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on numerous occasions

in addition to green mountain name has exhibited the same hard work and diligence on other texas transactions san name misc qse contracts etc
 

sounds like you are on the team   i am assuming you will start fulltime on monday   whalley has already assured me you will be part of this rebuild process which obviously requires fulltime focus

please confirm
 

i would say 2000000 for lavo approval   whether than signature i would go through deal specifics and get verbal approval


name

im pretty sure ive already been hit for some of these  if you could provide me a pl copy from june 1 thru today either electronic or paper id appreciate it
 

hi there

thanks for the note  it is very weird for sure  i never thought it would happen to name  one of the reasons i didnt go to a smaller shop even though i was offered more money was because i didnt want to deal with crap like this  lo and behold  life is strange  anyway at this point it looks like dynegy is the suitor for the big e  i think it will happen  the question will become where are we going to be located  fortunately i only have about 8 months left in my contract so i wont have to put up with too much crap for too long  well see

italy is awesome  really really is  i realize it more and more since i came back  tuscany is so cool  if you go there go to san quirico montecino and montepulciano  very cool little towns and good wine  name is very cool as well  i may go back there for a month or so this june if things arent to wacky  have a good time there im envious

sounds like you are doing better  also sounds like work is fun and challenging  so do you think you are going to stay there for a while  do you miss the west  i dont think ill live east of the rockies but you never know

well it looks like this year might be as interesting as last  i keep thinking things will mellow out a little but things keep getting more and more strange

it was great to hear from you and take care of yourself

name
 

im showing we have two deals in the system under bpa contract s 10123 and 10227

deal 85098 100 mw rtc busbar purchase 1048
deal 51353 102 mw rtc midc purchase 216

if there are additional transactions other than these i need to know within the next couple of hours

name
 

name

this looks like it will work  since there has been some confusion around this ill lay out what i think will happen with this language

assumption 1

mc on eol is 300 at 350
cob is not displayed on eol

product 1 is cob product 2 is mc

cobmc spread is 5  10 on eol

situation 1
customer lifts the cobmc spread at 10  name will then buy the mc at 325 and sell cob at 335

situation 2
customer hits the cobmc spread at 5  name will then sell the mc at 325 and buy cob at 329


this is how it should work

i suggest we test things out now and see how it works

thanks

one more thing  wed like to get some more spreads going  specifically the pvmc the npsp and the pvsp  i realize the pvsp might be a problem from a legal standpoint because of contract language but i would like to get the others going  can you give me a call some time today

thanks
 

name

due to the fact name killed several transactions as opposed to zeroing them out in scheduling the realtime position manager is out of balance for december 2 and december 3 at the midc and cob  december 1 looks ok  this seems like an issue that name is going to have to resolve since they know the deals that were killed  i will put the necessary interdesk swaps in on saturday but im going to leave sunday and monday open at this point  if you have any questions let me or name know

name
 

here are some questionscomments i have regarding the ruling

1  how does the cap apply to index prices  if the djpv index settles at 120 and the cap is 98 do parties selling index have to adjust there price to 98

2  would financial products swaps be affected by the cap

3  there has to be less ambiguity with respect to day ahead cash markets  for example assume its a monday and the iso is under normal conditions and the price is 92  then assume on he 14 the iso declares a stage one and the price clears at 100 and the price is 100 for the rest of the day  tuesday assume the price is 85 during the first few offpeak hours but the wednesday forecast shows identical conditions as monday  what is the day ahead cash cap trading tuesday for wednesday
is it 85 or 100  one could make the argument that it should be 100 because it is reasonable to assume they will be in a stage one real time on wednesday but at the time cash is traded they are not in a stage one

it seems to me the easiest way to solve this problem would be to have an independent market organization declare what the day ahead cash market price was before the cash market traded  so for the example they may recognize its likely a stage 1 100 cap will be in effect on wednesday so theyll set the cap at 100  the market will know before hand and there will be no ambiguity  more efficient market less litigation

4  what about call options  if a generator owns a call option at 125 the cap is 100 but the market is actually trading 150 does the generator have the right to exercise the option  what if the generator has a plant that he can fire up at 150  does the generator have to wait until the price hits 150  seems like the strike price on an option would be an easily demonstrable expense  and would there be a difference between a marketer owning an option and a generator owning an option
 

name

here is a brief personal work history  ive been in the utility industry pretty much since 1988  i started trading for portland general electric in 1995  ive been a trader for name for the last 4 years  i run names shortterm northwest book  i have marketmaking responsibility for the cash balance and prompt months for the midcolumbia and cob specifically although i am responsible for the entire northwest  i also trade palo verde sp15 and np15

i have recently talked with a couple of other trading outfits out west and generally the structure looks something like this

1  150 k base salary
2  250 to 300 k signing bonus
3  various bonus structures generally with a minimum guaranteed equal to the base salary

quite frankly a move to the east coast is not very appealing  the compensation package would have to be very attractive for me to seriously consider a move to that area  if you have any questions please let me know

thanks

we had a problem with the pge loss return on that day i thought we fixed it  anyway i put in a crossdesk deal 875570  thanks
 

here are my comments

1  i wouldnt agree the caps have hurt liquidity  in fact in the northwest at least they have actually increased liquidity  any decrease in liquidity can be attributed primarily to a couple of things 1 uncertainty about the level of the cap and 2 when the dayahead prices trade above the cap removing marketers as sellers

i would propose the following cap timelines  first of all i think its important that ferc realize the spot market really is two separate markets what we call the dayahead cash markets and dayof realtime markets  the 24hour designation doesnt dovetail with the current market timelines and is a source of confusion that can adversely affect liquidity and dispatch of power plants  for example dayahead cash typically trades from 600 am to approximately 700 am for next day deliveries  however on thursdays the wscc otc market trades for friday and saturday deliveries and on fridays we trade for sunday and monday all of this can be adjusted for various reasons but this is the typical schedule  if we held to the 24hour spot cap literally then tuesday thru friday the cap would apply to the dayahead market but would not apply to saturday and monday  this obviously cannot be an intended consequence  i recommend the cap timeline be consistent with the dayahead wscc otc trading timelines

in addition there is some question with respect to what cap applies to the dayahead market  what if the forecast calls for much higher temperatures and it is assured that realtime markets will be trading above the 85 threshold  assume that stage i ii or even iii is a certainty  it seems prudent that a higher dayahead price cap be established still consistent with fercs guidelines  why  because you would want units prescheduled to have high reserve margins going into realtime rather than scrambling to dispatch units realtime  it seems like it would be prudent for some independent board to set the dayahead price cap equal to either the 85 or stage i limit prior to trading time  this board would have to have regional representatives in order to be truly effective  establishing the cap does not have to be cumbersome or time consuming in fact it should be fairly easy

the cap governing realtime transactions is clear  however what isnt clear is what happens when the new stage i cap is actually lower than the existing 85 of stage i cap  for example during the first couple of days in july the realtime cap was operating under the 85 of stage 1 criteria approximately 92  the iso hit a stage i and stage ii and the price actually fell to the 70s  this created uncertainty exactly when it shouldnt happen  as a result supply was apparently affected in california and the southwest for a few hours across the peak  it seems odd that prices should fall realtime as reserve margins decrease  one could argue this is a good reason why caps should be tied to daily gas prices but assuming that isnt an option i propose something like this  the day before around 2200 the caiso or preferably an independent body would determine the realtime nonstage cap as well as a stage minimum  while in a stage i ii or iii the hourly price would be the higher of the nonstage price cap or the recalculated stage price  if the stage i price turned out lower then the nonstage price would be used for that hour but the recalculated stage i cap and corresponding 85 price would apply for the next operating day and for dayahead cash trading for the next trade day  this provides information before the trading period enhancing liquidity and eliminates strange price movements during realtime  it also fits the ferc price cap paradigm

2  marketer prices  i think there is a clear bias against marketers in the order  but given the fact it seems deliberately slanted against marketers there are clearly three areas where marketers should be allowed to recover costs that are easily demonstrable  first would be losses at a tie into california  if we sell at the cap and incurr losses then we cant sell at the cap  second would be the 10 credit premium  credit issues apply whether youre a marketer or generator  third would be call options  it seems if the market trades above the cap and above the strike in a call option that a party should be able to exercise and sell  im not sure what the difference between a peaking plant and a call option is

this gets even better  on tuesday april 3 i had our california prescheduler ask the iso day ahead personnel why the cob sn atc had been decreased so much  there reply was that the atc is calculated by taking the ttc less existing transmission contracts less ftrs less capacity benefit margin  normally and up until january 1 of this year they havent used a capacity benefit margin when calculating atc leaving the state  so the amount of atc they had at cob sn is normally in the 700 to 800 mw range rather than the 35 to 60 mw of atc they are using now

we asked what this capacity benefit margin was and they said its not in their tariff its in the nerc operating manual  i went to the nerc web site and sure enough capacity benefit margin is a defined term  it reads  capacity benefit margin is the amount of ttc reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements

the isos use of this language is outrageous  this is language to ensure that load has transmission access to remote generation  i can see them using this argument with respect to cob ns but no way cob sn  in fact one could very easily argue that they are violating this criteria  if we have load in the northwest and have purchased generation in california we should have access to available transmission
 

heres what changes  cob  we are not going to deliver to midesto deal  36894
mc  bpa deal  51353 and busbar bpa deal  85098 are cancelled
 

attached is a spreadsheet summarizing hourly ttc and atc data for cob sn from jan 1 2000 to april 2001  the data were obtained from the iso
after looking at the data it is clear that although the ttc values have not changed from 00 to 01 the atc values have decreased dramatically  i believe the reason for this is the isos attempt to prevent exports to the northwest

i propose that we send this spreadsheet to our iso rep via name name and ask him to explain the reason for the reduction

hey there

hows it going  i understand you guys stole one of our marketers  thats ok ill forgive you  things are insanely boring here  basically we are in a wait mode probably i think until february  this is the first time in 5 years i havent had to worry about pl and i have to say its pretty weird  its nice sleeping in though

so supposedly we have 14 potential suitors youve probably heard of the banks and ive also heard reliant is putting together a bid  that would be interesting  we laid off probably half the people in our officepretty much all back office support and some conservationrenewable people  bad timing  plus when we laid off name broadband folks they got a six month severance package and ebb didnt make any money and in fact lost a substantial amount  then name lays off people on our floor which has made a phenomenal amount of money and gives them basically 4000 taxed at 48  life is not fair

its going to be interesting to see what this does to the industry  i think the california debacle then name now calpine is going to create an interesting dynamic going forward  credit is going to become more and more an issue especially towards the back of the curve  its interesting i remember 5 years ago the prediction was when it was all said and done there would be 6 big energy suppliers in the country  looks like its heading that way

so are you going to europe  sounds like fun  if it looks like were going to be on the sidelines for a while i might go on vacation for a couple of weeks maybe hawaii

well im going to go grab a cup of coffee  i hope everything is well with you

take care

i havent had an opportunity to call you directly yet so i thought i would email you first and sort of lay out the circumstances

ive been a shortterm trader with name for about 4 years  i run our shortterm northwest book  prior to that i cash traded for portland general for a couple of years  my contract with name is up july 31 and i have a 3month noncompete obligation  theoretically the earliest i could leave name would be may 31 so the earliest i could start with another shop would be sept 1

to be honest at this point im shopping  im talking to a couple of other outfits and i basically want to see what sort of interest there is out there  i talked with name and he mentioned you so i thought it might be a good idea to get in touch  if you are interested in pursuing anything further please email me and well arrange a time we can talk over the phone

i call this product dart dayaheadrealtime  its basically a physical product that is transacted on a dayahead cash basis but is delivered on realtime  for example on the dayahead lets say i post a us pwr phy firm  midc peak oct04 to oct05 dart  27 at 28  if i get hit then the party selling to me is obligated to deliver on oct 5th realtime 25 mw each hour  i would be long realtime at 27  if a party lifts my 28 then i would be obligated to deliver to them on oct 5 realtime 25 mw each hour  i would be short at 28

the mechanics of this deal are much like a regular dayahead cash transaction  the primary difference is we would have to flag these deals somehow such that they would not get mixed with our regular dayahead transactions that needed to be prescheduled

as far as the product language goes i think if you add the following language to what you provided below we should be ok obviously subject to legal review

this product is intended to be transacted on a dayahead basis for delivery on a realtime basis  day ahead means the trading day prior to the day of delivery consistent with wscc scheduling and trading practices  realtime means the actual delivery day  realtime deliveries shall be consistent with generally accepted wscc scheduling timelines and practices

take a look give me a call  thanks
 

ive had an idea for a new eol product that i would like to start our eol legal and contracts people thinking about  its kind of a weird product but i think it would trade quite a bit once people figured out what it was

its called the day aheadrealtime parklend product  essentially its a financial trade on a day ahead basis that is settled real time  for example lets say morgan name agrees to sell us 25 mw onpeak for 25 but that it is not prescheduledit is to be settled real time  if we fast forward to realtime morgan name has two options  they can buy from us on eol whereby this transaction books out or they can deliver us physical power whereby we have to sell the power to a third party real time  the nice thing about this product is it provides any party the ability to take a position to real time even if they are not a control area  in addition it would provide utilities and generators the ability to hedge a dayahead position

name im not sure if its you i need to talk to about this but i would appreciate some direction if its somebody else  once we identify who we need to look at this id like to set up a conference call to discuss contract language and eol mechanics

thanks

hey

you sound kind of bummed out there amiga  understandable though  tough and very weird times thats for sure  very sad  the funerals must have been brutal  i know im depressed by it because i get these waves of sadness that hit me out of the blue periodically  hopefully things will improve

our stock has just been munched  it sucks because were doing well but the other half of the company appeared to be mostly smoke and mirrors  everyone was wondering why skilling left i guess we know why now

enough of the gloom and doom  sounds like you are getting opportunitiesthats good  i knew that you would  heres some proscons for your options recalling my vast experience  structuring  interesting but not alot of dough  probably the most easily replaced by those fresh mbas  trading  like being handcuffed to a schizophrenic on speed  can turn you into a frothing mass of neurosis at times  good dough if you make it though  marketing  low immediate constant stress but still competitive  you have a great deal of charm and brains so i think you would do quite well in this area  in addition there are a number of firms calpine aep coral who are opening up an office in portland pretty much geared towards midmarketing  might be opportunity down the road for you to move closer to home plus you can buy me beer which is always a plus for anyones karma

as far as your overall attitude towards the industry i think i disagree  i think its a good industry to be in particularly now because no matter what people need electricity  and its still changing especially out west so there will be challenges and opportunities

its great talking with you  cheer up  call your folks  run  punch a punching bag  do drugs kidding  take care of yourself and if you need anything give me a buzz or drop an email

name
 

thanks name  i think we might be interested in pursuing something  its kind of hectic right now so let me give you a call when things settle down a little bit  probably next week  talk with you later
 

we are 50 mw short at the midcolumbia during the offpeak hours for monday he 01 thru he 06 he 2324  we are short to portland general  when you buy put 25 mw in the shortterm northwest book and put the other 25 in the west hourly bom book

name
 

hey

today is a good time  email me with a number i can reach you at a time and ill give you a call from my cell phone

name
 

on august 16 2001 name counsel in dc requested that the name northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year  the data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for and for the most part names internal systems did not track the information in the format requested  since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money it was imperative that 1 the data be pulled together even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible 2 the data be as accurate as possible and 3 it be done in a very short period of time

the amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive  utilizing names comprehensive and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems we were able to accomplish this task  there were many instances where we hit a brick wall  specifically it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset although it was imperative we do so  name was instrumental in bridging this gap

as a result of her efforts we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in dc and subsequently for our ferc filing  i recommend that name receive a personal best award for the amount of 2000

name crandall


name  is this good enough
 

dow jones is interested as well  i really think a hourly index would be very useful price discovery financial positions etc
 

you are right  there are no deliveryscheduling obligations on the day ahead dart product unlike the regular dayahead  yes  a dart onpeak would mean delivery on all onpeak hours for the corresponding day and a dart offpeak would mean delivery on all offpeak hours for the corresponding day
 

name
 
the difference is because i rounded the purchase prices from aep and avista in the pl spreadsheet rather than taking a weighted average  the wire request amount is correct
 

name

here are the examples we talked about

assumptions

1  eol and broker market  cob 30  40
2  we put out a cobmc market 4 at 7
3  in eol product 1  cob and product 2  mc

heres what will happen in the broker market

a if someone hits my bid of 4 in the broker market i will buy cob at something like 35 and i will sell midc at 31
b if someone lifts my offer of 7 in the broker market i will sell cob at something like 35 and i will buy midc at 28

if you take the same assumptions and show this market on eol heres my understanding of what will happen

c if someone hits my bid of 4 on eol i will sell cob at 35 and i will buy mc at 39 compare this with a
d if someone lifts my offer of 7 on eol i will buy cob at 35 and i will sell mc at 42 compare this with b

clearly this doesnt work

one possible solution i think is to examine what happens if you put out a cobmc product on eol but switch the products such that product 1  mc and product 2  cob and assume we put the underlying product 1 market out as mc 30  40

e  if someone hits my bid of 4 on eol i will sell mc at 35 and i will buy cob at 39 achieves same result as a which is what we want
f  if someone lifts my offer of 7 on eol i will buy mc at 35 and i will sell cob at 42 achieves the same result as b which is what we want

i realize e and f dont jive with our long contract description but conceptually it works

if you have any questions let me know

attached are my final comments  they deal more with the proposal to curtail exports including muni  i dont really care if we file this with the material we have already put together or do something with it separately  with respect to the atc and ttc questions we were addressing earlier i havent added anything to what name put together  the caisos argument about restricting atc because of path 15 congestion because as name points out any technical problems would affect both ttc and atc  if anyone has any questions let me know

weve been experimenting with spreads on eol and i want to lay out to you what happens when you transact a spread on eol

assume you want to put out the cobmc spread 4 at 4  also assume cob is 275 at 300  as you know if you put this out in the broker market you would expect to buy cob 4 under midc or sell cob 4 over

if you want to duplicate these trades on eol you could put out cobmc 4 at 4 but here is whats going to happen assume cob mid is 2875  if somebody hits your bid you will sell cob at 2875 and buy midc at 2835  if somebody lifts your offer you will buy  cob at 2875 and sell mc at 2915  effectively the eol transaction turns your bid into an offer and an offer into a bid or the title is cobmc but the transaction is mccob  the problem it seems to me is that fundamentally bid is always first offer is second  for this to work as is the market would have to accept that in all cases bidoffer applies except with eol spreads where its offerbid

this seems too confusing to me  im not sure how you guys feel about  it but i want to give you a heads up
 

wow  a long time  i was out june 5 and came back on july 2  i thought it was 3 weeks but it was more

i want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions
 
i think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint   i want to be able to represent to employees that lawyering the docs to death is not necessary because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees
 
i would like an affirmative yes on this question by tuesday am
 
does everyone agree
 

please make a recommendation that keeps this individual   i have given my views and they are falling on deaf ears   please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 7580k   this seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult
 

these are not good fills   when i gave the order dis was trading at 2187 2186 at 2188   i can understand 23 cents but not 9 cents

	name herndon
	name name

yes we probably can because esca is the vendor and we have a great relationship with them  i will ask name andor forney to followup

	2 by counterparty
 

thanks   any assignment would have to be confidential   i dont view an assignment any different than the unwinds that we are currently doing directly with the customer   if there is a positive npv trade we should do it   assignment maybe the wrong word   maybe we can transfer the ercot switching risk to another supplier or back to the customer

calpine is in complete disarray right now and the entire future of their company hinges on ca honoring their long term above market contracts   calpines nonca portfolio is getting killed and i dont think they have hedged effectively in the nonca locations

given these circumstances the word below market is an f word particulary with the legal concerns they also have   i would place a low probability on getting to a value proposition that makes sense for both parties at dighton particularly with the legal issues
 

chemistry is very important to me and i am rewarding name for his loyalty and low maintenance   in addition he demonstrated much improved risk management skills that last 6 months of last year   name working for name is very capable and will do a great job for us in the se    name saibi will come over from ercot and run the cash books in the se

the parties attorneys have 48 hours to agree on lawsuit termination language at which time the icap transaction becomes a binding obligation on both parties

the hourly index is a must for me the dayahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years   it is important to understand that under the new proposed structure vepco will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge  
i will not due this deal based on a dayahead index  it must be hourly at the interface we defined

please clarify your call option vs firm delivery comment
 

sounds like you are as busy as i am   yes my parents still live in the same house in kennewick   my dad retired from teaching in wa collecting wa retirement and has been teaching in hermiston or for the last 7 years

just to clarify names international business model and north american business model are quite different   i work in the name north american business unit which has been extremely profitable and has pioneered the deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in the us   name nas focus has been on creating efficient wholesale markets in gas power crude pulp  paper metals etc and then providing the market with a logistical delivery and price risk management intermediation function   we are very cost effective in this function because we achieve huge scale and scope in the market with minimal fixed costs

names international business model on the other hand entailed constructing capital intensive infrastructure power and gas projects with leveraged project financing with project financing supported by long term sales to government utilities   this model is ok provided the business risk currency risk international risk change in law risk legal risk etc is priced properly by the debt and equity providers

i will let you conclude which business model is better   i think you will see name applying our successful na model into the international markets that have an economy and regulatory environment that supports a freemarket model

later
 

full access of the complete portal should be limited to core contract employees only   we have a scaled down version that we have made available to the marketing group
 

good info   consistent with reports from mcgowan   i am now short 02 at 39ton and long 0304 at 3250ton   love the spread given my view of natty

since the report is almost identical to info i have received from mcgowan i dont see any pressing need to call name   you are certainly free to call him if you want
 

you are 100 correct  that is my impression as well and that is why i set up the monday meeting  going forward the format of those meetings should be

	1 richter presents his area of accountability west wholesale prosition risk systems deal capture system status of 	projects schedule etc
	2 black presents his area of accountability deal review west tariff  and gas
	3 herndon presents his area of accountability east wholesale  east tariffs
	4 name presents his area of accountability deal structuring deal valuation new model construction
	5 busby presents his area of accountability risk systems and portfolio valuation  works with richter
	6 you and i find the holes and provide direction

your thoughts
 

name nicolay and name novosel are the two best regulatory people   in terms of pushing the timing political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from kean and lay   obviously that will not work anymore   i have a good relationship with larcamp ferc head of staff and might be able to help with the politics   i think ferc is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner   if we want speed i recommend we use the expertise of name and name combined with the overall political clout of the new owner

you are not off base with steffes at all
 

please print and put in binder for me   please combine the document from yesterday in the same binder so i can read the whole package while im on vacation
 
thanks
 

right now all of our trades are fixed price at a specific hub   we will be moving to basis markets in some locations in the very near future
 

you are right   they are on crack   this would be at least 350mwh over cin   they have gas deliverability issues in the winter and there alternative fuel is no 2 oil   therefore cpl east is a big premium novmar   the bidoffer for this location is large due to transmission risk
 

for the 25th presentation i need the following

a pictorial description of power generation sources	1 nuclear
							2 coal
							3 resid steam unit
							3 gas combined cycle
							4 gas simple cycle
							5 hydro

i would like to show annual demand by customer segment residential commercial industrial for the east west and ercot and supply by generation type for the same major areas   a table which shows mwh consumption by demand segment and generation supply by source would be useful   in addition total capability by supply source

some of this same info can be used for the 30th presentaiton
 

good luck name   i appreciate your praise and wish you success in your future professional endeavors
 

i have done multiple trades today and i also did several last week   please clean up my holdings page to net longs and shorts   how is your office reacting to the news about ubs acquiring our energy trading operation

thanks
 

name  namet worry about the formatting   after playing around some more i have a new way that works fine for me    the main issue is keeping the database live with all of the historical information    we can figure out how to format

thanks
 

we need an immediate legal review to see what are ongoing  risks are in ercot   the deficiency of 6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of the qses on a prorata basis however what if the deficiency is 100 million and we our prorata share is 3 million

do we have any legal recourse   do they suspend the deficient qse immediately
 

we would prefer physical rights that we can take dayahead andor realtime 5 minutes ahead if possible   rather than an obligation like ftrs we prefer an option spread on pricing that can only be positive when exercised
 
i would want to condition the transaction on having one rto in the ne with lmp pricing in effect for the entirie ne market on or before 112003   assuming we get over those hurdles this would likely be viewed as a capital project internally fixed cost structure therefore we need to earn a minimum of 25 expected return after credit
 
obviously there is a huge unknown on the ct vs long island forward curve with the changing market conditions   this makes pricing this deal extremely difficult particulary with the returns we would need to show
 
call me with any additional questions
 

i talked with name today and he wanted me to remind you about the email you voluntered to write regarding the transition of site profile accountability back to ees   if you recall we decided on a 23 month transition with some sort of drop dead accountability for all pl risks associated with the site profiledsm positions

do you remember this  if so name and i did not receive the email
 

you have the latitude to put your key people under contract   name was very clear when i talked to her that she wanted to transition into a marketing role where she would interact directly with customers
 

i think i can get name name done with a simple title change from associate director to director with no salary change   his current salary is already director level type comp   i potentially may need another 25k but the title is a feel good issue that is important to name   please talk to name directly on the justification
 

please use the next week to clean up our database of delivery locations and regions currently still in enpower   i would like to start the database clean with only the key hubs listed

nepool ptf
ny zone j
ny zone g
ny zone a
name
pjm east hub
pjm west hub
pjm west
name
comname
name
name
name
ercot south fp
ercot north basis

lets use this opportunity to clean up enpower and start with a truly clean set of books  
team  am i missing anthing
 

you have the right name presto   i have been employed at name now for almost 7 years   i currently oversee the companys power trading and marketing business in the eastern us    unfortunately i spend entirely too much time at work but i love the job and names culture in general

how are you doing   i have not seen any of my tricity classmates in many years   i think the last time i saw you was at name bayless wedding 8586 if my memory is correct

where is your job located and what work have you done with name
 

this transaction was never in the trading books and all pl and decisionmaking was within the origination group   i may have recommended that ozzie buy the balance of year coal however all  impacts and decisions were within the control of origcorp development

therefore name ozzie and name miller are the parties that must deal with any of the contractual issues and intracompany monetary issues
 

name colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization   my understanding is that delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year   please confirm with name
 

looks like ader  co at work in ercot   i view this as a big problem   these customers need to be covered by wholesale   both of you should take this as a slap in the face
 

i have book positions in the ne market and am very comfortable with our curves through 2004 in all of these markets    nepool came off very hard today 200mwh through 2006 while the ny markets were off only 050  100mwh   i am paying close attention to these markets given the corporate risk and i dont see any marks unreasonable given where 02 and 03 are actually trading

again  i will continue to monitor as we work toward integrating the positions

thanks
 

please net longs and shorts for dia and dyn   i will do almost all trades online therefore i would like some mechanism to make all trades net on the holdings page
 

all fixed price locations ercot ent cin tva soco comname pjm nepool etc   the biggest cal positions are cin ent pjm and nepool
 

one group needs to mark curves   i personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region   i simply need to make it a priority again   i can go either way though   we definitely dont want two sets of curves

let me know
 

name international purchased all of comnames gas and coal plants approx 2 years ago and now sells the output of these plants back to comname through 2004

the operators of the plant are threatening a strike and it could have huge implications with plant availability until replacement operators could be found   i would like your group to closely monitor this situation and provide me daily feedback
 

i concur with name on approach with one clarification   transmission providers discussions should include both a trading rep and marketing rep
 

our marks are fine at least through 04 where we occasionally see s   i dont think its appropriate to shut down anything  we need to price the product properly and offpeak needs just as much margin as onpeak given the increase in coal prices and the effects of load growth

rather than shut down products increase the price to reflect the current risk in the market   we are chipping away at our offpeak position day by day and we have bought some nymex coal

am i making sense   in addition i am working with name to buy 7x24 from fpl in north texas for both desks   we will probably have to pay 350400 spread to get 35 year 7x24 deal done

with respect to ne the outright prices are much higher and resid is the marginal unit for offpeak therefore in some ways the risk is easier to manage
 

how come you never show eol s for east power   i would like to see east power included in the email report

thanks
 

name indicated that credit has agreed to allow creditworthy counterparties to trade through 2004   the following are the counterparties east power would like to have 04 access on eol

name
name
bp energy
name
morgan name
el paso

please let me know asap who gets approved and when eol will grant trading rights

thanks
 

the esca energy management system ems in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with nerc standards   we used the software and hardware for remotely controllingoperatingdispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party outsourcingservices deals in ercot and spp
 
i hope this helps
 

we are losing lots of deals in ercot on price  this is part of the reason they are being so aggressive with customers and alternative suppliers   i have received this feedback directly from name and name
 

namet worry christi  i recognize what a great job your group did this year   it was by far the best regulatory effort from a power perspective with more results than any of the previous 7 years i was at name   you and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together we will reap the benefits for years to come
 

name name suarez gupta name schiavone misra wang and ballato also need to be able to trade gas or there equivalent trading books need to be able to trade gas if the above names change
 

the only issue i have is everytime i login i have some windows installer program i have to kill and it takes me an extra 23 minutes to keep closing files before i can get into my desktop

i dont know what caused this but i am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run   in addition the dialup through citrix is very very slow   is this normal

any thoughts

thanks for all your work  the printer works just fine
 

i think this guy should be independent from the fundies   there may be special projects that are highly confidential in nature that should be directed by you name name and myself   i think name would be more successful in a freelance role

other input
 

the same attachment was sent again in case you had trouble opening the previous file   i am sending from home via the network and have been having some problems   sorry to email you to death
 

the average guy has no idea what is coming   td costs are going to explode and so is wholesale power increased om security employees capital improvements risk premium etc
 

please put on calender and remind all desk heads to invite people who have signed up   this includes you name and name
 

please proceed with name on taking the prudency you are comfortable with   name will have to get approval from name andor lavo

thanks
 

what do you need from me   do you want me to meet with him  talk to him on the phone   go to lunch    is he looking for a job    as you can see i dont have much information of the objective here
 

obviously coordination with gas and power fundies rika imai and chris gaskill is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope   my view is no 1 is part of rikas core day to day world   no 2 and no 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill

i will be out wednesday through friday so we should sit down tomorrow
 

we have some serious issues   downgrade collateral called liquidity crisis issue more equity   i can see 12 pretty easy

i think both lay and fastow are gone
 

as i discussed with joe deffner the name transaction we recently completed loan in a commodity deal we were unable to get the exception language for collateral   we did the transaction at libor  10bp and even when we add 6575 bp for the cost of an lc the transaction still provided a competitive source of cash

the confirms we sent incorrectly placed the exception language and i am correcting that today
 

please put name name contact information get from name in my outlook contacts  home cell work address etc and put a reminder on my calender to call him to reestablish contract relationship
 
also please put a reminder to call name giffels regarding consulting agreement and fpl
 

notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less   additionally if we use them as sink when we go hourly they will have to be part of the dayahead tag   if these issues are not crystal clear with them i have no interest in even showing an offer
 

absolutely   i may have to smooth over the name mehn issue name committed to go to wholesale structuring
 

they are pursuing because i requested to pursue   the reason for the email is to place management emphasis on this opportunity
 

yes we need prb 8400 and prb 8800 curves   my agreement with egm was coal curves in exchange for power curves

name  if i dont get the prb coal curves by the end of this week i will have to remove access to our power curves
 

name
 
this looks good   you have my blessing to proceed with approval from the cash committee   you can reach me at home 7138567483 if you have any additional questions
 
thanks
 

the meeting has been moved to tommorow at 1100 am   we can discuss these issues before the meeting
 

i talked with lavo and we agreed herndon and black should go as well   i think zufferli would make 14 but we should be able to squeeze

i am calling aviation today and i plan on arranging the following

	1 plane goes to portland and picks up your guys at 900 am on friday 621 or 628 if more notice is required
	2 plane picks up name guys at approx 330400 pm name time
	3 we arrive in cabo around 700 pm
	4 plane returns to name 600 pm sunday
	5 plane continues to portland and arrives around 800 pm portland time

let me know if this works for you guys
 

i view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites gas and power with the estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore   the estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors

i cant imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by ubs and the estate   i am not planning on giving any of the data to the estate   i feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well   one of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area
 

none that i am aware of   we need to take positions that support our long term view of competitive energy markets for all consumers
 

joe holmes from idacorp 2083182100 called and expressed interest in names services deals in the na presumably in the west

name  can you have someone followup   thanks
 

the source sink issue continues to be a huge thorn in our side and costs my group significant s every year   i estimate 1015 million per year is lost by our cash traders every year due to the inflexibility in the daily and weekly market

therefore we should continue to fight this issue hard to rectify as soon as possible

thanks
 

i do not agree with this approach   we are so busy managing stacks which could lead to someone forgetting to inform settlements to send a termination letter which would then kill the trade  i strongly object to your recommended approach
 

the highlights i would focus on are

1 east power has traded over 600 million mwhs ytd 2001 compared to 450 million mwhs for all of 2000
2 averaging 350 trades per day on eol for 2001 ytd compared to 100 in 2000   in the last two weeks eol daily transactions have averaged nearly 500
3 significant improvement in liquidity in all markets  epmi now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market
4 positive pl in every eastern region
5 outstanding return on var
 

make sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any vepco interface hourly or dayahead and the pjmvepco pjm lmp index is for pricing only
 

i hear you on the liquidity name   with name making those markets effective next monday he is on vacation we will find out if term liquidity is possible

please trust me on this issue   you will see a significant difference within weeks not months   at a minimum you will at least have price discovery through 2003 on calenders they may be 3 wide in new york but that is better than no market

keep pushing on this issue   with the volatility in the ne over the past two weeks im sure you understand our reluctance on term markets in these illiquid areas

as far as 02 or 03 quotes for e pjm andor ny i have heard no markets today and neither has dana   the pool is blowing up as we speak
 

i sit at 06543 will be moving wednesdaythursday   i can meet midmorning tommorow   get on my calender with tj at 35800

thanks
 

good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift  much appreciated  the family is great  name just turned 3 and name is now 4 months old

i hope name and the kids are doing great  hows your new addition   we will be going to miami sept 1316 miami revenge on washington and hopefully we can hook up for a beer

as far as the guy from citizens  we really dont know that much about him   where is name altman  under a bus somewhere
 

name

are we are discussing the phoenix project at this wednesdays meeting   is terry going to be there
 

you will probably be glad you didnt go   if the boys are in jail in mexico you may have to run the desk the next week
 

please complete haydens form for your respective regions  

keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by ubs so be careful in completing this form   in addition ubs has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking pl    the liquidity reserve accounts for the fact you cant liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably cant even liquidate at the bid offer

thanks
 

we need all historical data preserved in all markets price vol trades by counterparty volume by counterparty broker vs eol broker prices eol prices etc

youve got that right   im am short all of the power and am getting frustrated   i am breaking all of the trading rules by ignoring the price action which continues to be somewhat bullish in power   there seems to be very solid fixed price support at these lower levels

in particular the ne markets refuse to go down despite the fact that benson has been a fairly aggessive seller the past two days in the 02 and 03 period   for the 1st time in a couple of weeks however the cash market is showing signs of weakness

overall i am very bearish and my position reflects that   like you i have worn some curveshift the past month
 

deny the request and the requester needs to send a formal request directly to me with solid justification
 

please remind me to file expense report from ct trip   in addition please block my calender from feb 6th to 10th for florida miami vacation   please also change the march vacation to march 913 disneyworld
 

i concur   you know we are likely selling new albany this week and i am assuming enas premium obligation can be terminated in the event of the sale of the asset
 

only if nuclear fuel storage problems persist   the nuclear fleet if unencumbered by nrc or spent fuel storage problems will operate at 9095 95 during nonrefueling years and 90 during refueling years
 
remember refuelings are now on a 24 month cycle and the next big cycle is spring and fall of 2003   the 2002 refueling outages are actually less than normal
 

yes lavo and name are both aware   this is a lateral transfer   name will be working directly for name

not at all  please attend   however we will need a bigger room   can you coordinate with tj to make this happen

thanks
 

thanks for the info name   in terms of forward curve entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now   the equipment is probably of more interest as it relates to a packaged development for the midway project in florida
 

as soon as i get access to crude resid  coal curves i will grant access to power curves

thanks
 

thanks name   i think name would fit in with our group well   i probably need to wait at least a week to let the dust settle on our own people issues    my guess is we will end up losing 23 people and outside candidates then become viable
 

i understand all of those comparisons however the reality is if we lose name which we will if we dont pay 65k  10k we will end up hiring a replacement at 7580k   this is pretty easy math for me

i know it seems like a stretch but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now   i would like to get this done asap

thanks
 

please ensure that realtime prices for ercot pjm ny and nepool are added to the cube database   i have been analyzing the data today and the realtime clearing prices are not there

thanks
 

i talked to name havilend about paine webber keeping my online portfolio manager updated with all of my name options   entering options is tricky and i was hoping you can provide that service for me

let me know
 

my preference is normal energy only ld language  if we agree to use an index pricing point like pjmvepco interface then a fair tradeoff is to eliminate the capacity ratchet
 

1  name can trade any region with 30 day limit and total position limit of 100 mw    name will do mostly spread trades
2  per our earlier discussion
3  ontario is part of the ne and we plan on having an ontario market maker   i have to sort this out with milly   please stay silent on this one until we get the deal closed
4
 

filing looks good  my vote is go forward with a clean 205 filing as attached
 
if we file the 203 as well ferc will gravitate directly toward that   i think we retain more flexibility if we stick with the 205 approach
 
other thoughts   i will be in florida vacation wednesday through friday    i can be reached via cell and tj will have my hotel phone     in addition i will check emails at least once per day at the hotel business center
 

i think you are probably correct   upon closure you will probably be marking your own curves   having said that you should probably begin now
 

sold 150 contracts per month of febmar 02 at 281

good question   we need to shift as of a specific date with fixed load obligations in the ews retail books
 

thanks name   i agree with the approach   it would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the east and west tradingmarketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything

see you tommorow

thanks
 

750k is bs   name has only been working on this for 34 weeks   he has made one trip to nebraska   i expect more like 50100k in costs incurred   this is precisely why i told name to work directly with name on this project

with respect to ameren name should work directly with me and name name

thanks
 

resume looks impressive   we should definitely interview him   i forwarded email to name to see if she knows the guy from her london gas trading days
 

i keep the curves very tightly controlled due to proprietary reasons   i lose control of who has access outside my group therefore i have chosen to not make it available   eol has prices in all markets through 2003 which should be all you need to perform your analysis
 

yes i would like to attend meeting regarding nrg deal and lets have a position meeting this afternoon at 400   does that work   i will keep my ears open for zone j and g markets   pjm east markets are rarely shown except for summer spreads which are now 1825mwh approx for 02 and 03
 

you got it  i will be in cabo this weekend with wolfes boss tim belden  my counterpart in the west and i will talk with him about their realtime trading needs and timing
 

i would support this 100   it is consistent with the direction that whalley lavo and delainey are headed with the retail risk management group
 

can you please coordinate this meeting to ensure it is productive   we may need an initial screening mtg to assess whether the tool can help us from a fundamentaltrading standpoint

thanks
 

we just successfully bought out of the 02 oppd capacity and energy obligation   therefore we dont need to proceed with the diesel installation

i have instructed name to make your group whole on any costs incurred pursuing the diesel development in nebraska

in addition i would like to pursue an 02 lm6000 project inside ameren approx 100150 mw   this would be a strategic asset to create a control area around and utilize the flexible interconnections ameren has with multiple systems   we also have significant retail load obligations behind ip and ameren in illinois

thanks
 

as most of you know nrgs proposed purchase of two coal plants in conneticut uis territory was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at ferc   the purchase and sale transaction between wisvest and nrg was originally entered into almost two years ago   the proposed purchase price of 350 million for 1000 mw of coal was a bargain price at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of ct
 
over the past 23 years the state of conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they puked the plants to nrg for 350kw in early 2000   at a minimum it is expected that 100150kw of scr andor scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the ct regulatory bodies
 
my strong view is that as a practical matter the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in ct   the area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire eastern interconnect   the load pocket is significantly short mw and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area   in a true locational marginal price environment the prices would likely be similar to zone j in new york   currently pricing in nepool is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads regardless of who causes the congestion   
 
in the recently proposed single ne rto model it is about 80 certain that the pjm locational marginal price market model will be implemented sometime between mid2003 and mid2004   at that point in time consumers in the congested areas of nepool incity boston and ct will be exposed to higher energy prices while consumers in maine new hampshire and rhode island should see lower prices
 
given the facts above coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets i think ews should pursue discussions with wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in nepool and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset node   
 
if we could buy these plants for approx 250kw with 150kw of environmental upgrades the resulting allin depr fixed  variable om fuel costs nox so2 capital reserve interest 7x24 plant cost would be approx 3436mwh    this is lower than our energy only socialized nepool curve   additional upside is derived from positive basis icap ancillary services emissions allowances and long term requirements sales to lses
 
lavo and name  this could be the name ppa for 2002   lots of hair but lots of upside

i want only firm delivered ld offers for this position   please make this clear in our proposal and make sure the volume shape is exactly the same as our jea obligation

from east powers perspective the east pjm development site is the only siteturbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of east pjm
 

i am missing an name 10000 share sale from monday of last week   the sale has not shown up in my online holdings report as it normally does

i am assuming this will be corrected today

thanks
 

i generally agree with your approach  we may be able to assign our contracts to a competitor and actually get paid because of margin in contract vs current market particularly if competition is not pricing this risk or choosing to ignore it   potential candidates are green mountain new power co txu etc

any thoughts
 

im not doing this interview   i told name duran we have no interest and im not going to waste my time on this individual
 

tj
 
please provide me with the latest hard copy so i can have one final meeting with my direct reports to get final confirmation for east power seating
 
thanks
 

find out if owners of current season tickets get grandfathered for equivalent seats in the new arena   if so i would be interested   if not i would say no
 

i agree with this approach and im fine with this allocation   my objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination   i caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs 8 hour tolls vs 16 hour and i could tell there was a disconnect

thanks
 

i would like to recommend to following allocations of retention s  this creates no net impact on total s on the spreadsheet

please call with any questions   i feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we dont do this
again i am not spending any additional s  i am simply taking from other people who will not be part of ubs
 

name is out   we are not extending an employment at will offer   please destroy the contract offer and drafted employee at will offer
 

i like your approach   would the norfolk location fill the ui short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit
 

hes making his rounds   i believe he is talking with corp risk and reck   i get the impression he doent want to be anywhere near an energy commodity that has a relationship with power which of course is all of them
 

i am trying to customize the view and i keep getting an error   can you check into this problem

i want the view for both portfolios to be		open date
						name
						purchase price
						last price
						cost basis
						market value
						gainloss
						gainloss

can you make this the default view setting

thanks
 

because we have lost several people to retail risk management name herndon narsima misra name homco etc and name forney has moved to ercot hourly i have been forced to manage an eol stack for multiple markets

therefore all tours during trading hours 630 am to 330 pm will have to be provided by nontrading personnel

sorry but we are in our busiest season and i cannot afford to have my traders away from the desk for even 10 minutes
 

the time is right in the middle of trading on an aga day   therefore it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend   i would suggest having name may andor name attend
 

could you please make sure this is on my calender and ensure that name name and name duran are also aware of this meeting

thanks
 

all east traders will have east only trading rights except for me    with respect to regions assume the same organization as we ended with in early november   the one change is name in the se along with suarez and name

ercot  name name schiavone saibi
ne  dana benson gupta name name offpeak misra name makkai step schneider

remember all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well   none of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas
 

i believe wabash has also terminated
 
name
as you know we had a meeting like this the week prior to christmas and had an accurate list at that time   our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred   i think the meeting is warranted however we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues
 
i will see you on wednesday at 200 pm
 

name can be reached by email at drherndonaolcom

thanks
 

i need the reg gen postion transmission position distribution position and ancillary position   if you have to bundle the td and ancillary into one position that is fine   however i want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the mwh position

thanks
 

name he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly   this essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 mw in the cal and 40 mw in the junesept   can we at least get a 50 mw block in the junesept period
 

i talked to giffels today and he mentioned that songs units are under serious security scrutiny given its location   he gave us a 5050 probability that indian pt 12 30 minutes north of ny city and pilgrim 15 minutes north of boston would be shut down in the near term for security reasons

he mentioned that songs was also a candidate   i personally dont think the probability is that high nonetheless the rumors seem to be in the market
 

we are in jail in offpeak as well and are trying to buy   most regions have markets online through 2003 tva ent cinergy comed   in ny there is zero liqidity for offpeak   pjm west has pretty decent liquidity through 03

i hope this helps
 

i will be in town monday and tuesday   out wedfri in florida   i will definitely help on monday andor tuesday   i can make arrangements for backups later in the week if necessary
 
let me know
 

looks like enpower is on the side of the road with respect to capturing and valuing retail deals   as we discussed in yesterdays meeting plan b is a more robust spreadsheet that unbundles the components and values them separately and creates postions by risk component

i know this is easier said than done but we need a tactical solution that gives the group confidence that value and positions are correct rather than a bundled black box batch value with hard coded assumptions
 

no problem   050mwh is enough for this service   you dont need to pay a 100mwh   i would say anytime she gets more that 75mwh she gets a 100mwh to keep her motivated to sell at the highest price

sound ok

in addition make sure we understand the steam obligation and its effect on dispatch flexibity and heat rate  it appears the 8000 heat rate is assuming above market steam sales are buying down the heat rate   solar turbines in combined cycle without a steam sale credit would usually have a heat rate around 10000 btukwh

the lower heat rate is probably predicated on providing 24 hour steam which means less dispatch flexibility and producing offpeak energy at a loss

make sure we are modeling these dynamics properly


whatever you want us to do is fine  we just want to hang out with you guys and enjoy some time with yall  cant wait its gonna be a blast

congratulations  job well done
 

lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything  i believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload  i have always believed that if we have an effective corporate newsletter we dont need these subsidiary newsletters  meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter  at ets we used to have periodic fyi newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover

you and i also need to do a budget review  the cost i am hearing from your group are to big for egs to support  i had truly hoped that names group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover egs  names group was covering ets and eott  i think name has a pr person so we need to find out what pr costs are in the wind company  also nbps has there own pr person

please set up a meeting with name and tracy

sorry but it is names policy not to comment on these types of things  rest assured that we have very experienced people who are evaluating  offers we receive for any asset thank you
 

q2 needs to be on plan  work hard
 

thanks for the report  just what i needed
 

i trust everything is going well  please let me know if there is anything i can do  at the next board meeting i am sheduled to provide the board with an update of name global services  could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on portland  one should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 2001 ie rate case etc in bullet form  the second should be an update of the deal with nng  perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events  call if you have questions  thanks  the board meeting is scheduled for december 6th
 

thanks for the update
 

i am sorry i did not get to you first and let you know  my apologies  i really appreciated your interest in the position and your commitment to ets  you are a quality individual and i respect you for that  thanks

it sounds like the due diligence with ubs is going fairly well with no real surprise  the news is good on indian mesa i and ii both on the deal with aep and the financing  the real target is completion of the project on time

i am ok with the release and the mou
 

i know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on  i can assure you that at times i too feel that i do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct  i can tell you that name mcmahon did receive the offer from the name bank of scotland at or around rab  i have supplied him the potential financial impact of name accepting that offer  as of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer  i suspect that a decision should be made early next week  i would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me

name lay and dynegy have both characterised names investments in water assets as noncore which means of cource that they will be divested in due time  i would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment  we all recommended that if name could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell wessex at or around rab  that is where we are right now  again please send me your comments  i would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision  i am sorry if i have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks  things are quite hectic as you can imagine
 

the list looks complete
 

first of all congratulations on completing your degree  having completed my masters degree by going to school at nights and saturdays while working full time i know first hand the commitment that takes  i suggest that you work through name name in trying to find the right position  she knows name smith vp of hr for ets  between the two of them they should be able to offer you the right advise  keep me informed

to get hard to find tickets go to the plaza hotel borders central park near fao schwartz entering through the front door proceed ahead around the big lobbytea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth literally a closet  cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows  she is completely independent from the hotel and im sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has  they are always wonderful seats to and usually run around 100 for each ticket  it is always a worthit splurge if it is for a play you want to see  i used to have her card but it is long gone by now  you might be able to call the plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead  otherwise just stop in as soon as you get in town
 
rent is ok but if this is your first and maybe only trip to nyc for a while i would certainly recommend seeing other plays first 
 
i agree with name your best hotel bet is the marriott name which is very nice for a marriott and the location is the best

we are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with questar southern trails in the blanco hub and will send you a copy soon for your review  since the interconnect is fully reimbursable questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs paying all of it up front  

please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments  if we allow them to pay along the way i am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect  the total estimate of 702000 includes the tax gross up which may or may not be applicable so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount


does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule

hey guys and girls

name has a sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of the trip  i sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking for something closer to our sights  i received an immediate response from the hotel condotti  they have 3 standard rooms available  i believe it is a 3 star hotel im guessing from the prices they charge  from the article in my book they have recently remodeled  they are located near our hotel firenze between the spanish steps and plaza name popolo  the rate is 430000 lire approximately 215  its 25 more than the sheraton but we wont have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which gives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap  they also have a 72 hour cancellation policy there could be a slight fee to cancel their fax just says they have a 72 hour cancellation fee if we are ok ill confirm this cancellation with our reservation 

i think we should go with this  im not sure how fast ill hear from the others if at all

please let me know your thoughts asap

my italian amigos

i have just received a fax from the marincanto hotel positano  they do have availability for us beginning may 25 for 3 nights  they have at least one standard double room sea view for euro 186 approximately 165 usd and one superior double room also sea view for euro 217  approximately 192 usd  the only difference between the rooms that i can tell from their fax is that the superior room has a jacuzzi bath  i do not know where in the room the jacuzzi is located  this hotel has a private beach i think i read somewhere in one of my books that there was a small nominal fee to use the beach with a private descent wahoo  they also have private parking at the cheap price of euro 18 per day and only a thousand uphill each way steps to it  

is this hotel still ok  i do not know if they have two standard room and two superior rooms or just one of each type available  please let me know what your preference is  i can clarify in my next fax  if both our preferences are for the same type room and they only have one of each shall we draw straws or have a pizza eating contest

also there was one other hotel in positano that i looked into before finding hotel marincanto for our sept trip but they were full  i may look them up tonight and fax them tomorrow just to compare

please advise

i got back yesterday and am back at work although i hesitate to call it that  i had a good time back home went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks which felt ok  its been awhile since ive been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing  it feels good to be back too  

i hope you had a relaxing break and are feeling productive again

yah  the brutal part is that im sure those planes are no where near full
 

eze

im glad you made it to yoga last night  how did you think the space compares to yim  dont worry you wont hurt my feelings  theyre very different and im always surprised when people prefer something like yim but yoga tastes vary widely  i thought last nights class was excellent and im glad we all got to go  im not sure why jai goes to yoga  ive been to a few classes with him and its always the same deep frustration with poses but   

yah the jump thru to seated is fun eh  last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly  once you do it once you can do it forever  also fun is to do the reverse  i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then youll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly

ians email is indeed iancookeenroncom

ceilis could be fun tomorrow  let me know when you go  this week has gone by quickly  i can understand how you didnt see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark but what about the one on my forehead last night

im not happy about you deploying though dude  do you know what your role will be

definitely catch up when im back
 

well i am back at work although i hesitate to call it that  there is not much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to the trading operations which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank in a week or so  well see   at first it was refreshing to not have anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere im used to here but now its a challenge to find productive ways to fill the time and i dont work very long days  

i had a good time back home went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks which felt ok  its been awhile since ive been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing  it feels good to be back too  

your schedule sounds very packed  maybe you would like to suggest a timeplace that fits in  its been forever since ive seen you and i would be up for anything  coffee lunch dinner drinks basically anything  

take care

do you use microsoft outlook  or some bizarre corel product  yes it would be terrible to allow employees access to a cdrom drive  productivity would plummet  enron let their employees have cdroms and look what happened to them

hi

i work at name as a power trader and name hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a junior power risk management position at epcor onto you 

name wong worked for us on booking the sundance b ppa position and was let go soon after this was sold to transcanadaaltagas and if youre still looking for someone he would be worth investigating  

regards
 

looks good  im working some stuff now that is writing to the z drive for publishing on the web  i will have it write to i and set it up so it will be easy to change from now going forward  should be able to tell if it works from that  i think your idea was a good one
 

im going by bankers hall today  any interest in lunch  i want another round of that blackened chicken
 

bitch  you have to let me see them
 

hey dude

i hear youre engaged  congratulations  whats going on  i havent been in touch with anyone in the last year or so  things have been going well in canada but my company is melting down so not sure what im going to be doing and probably wont know for awhile  im going to be home dec 16  jan 3  are you going to be around  looking forward to catching up 

coop
 

dude  youre overreacting  i think she was flustered by your voracious flirting and pulled the chute

hey jon

i didnt get around to calling you this weekend but am hoping to touch base this week  ok to give a call in the evenings  im beginning to think about this as a long term project and look forward to hearing your thoughts  

	coop
 

dont do that to me
 

be still my heart
 

that motherboard does look sweet  why the scsi drives though  personally i want to find a raid card that can handle raid5 everything ive seen is 01or 01 and then link up a bunch of smallish ide drives  if the controller is good you dont need super fast and expensive drives so you get speed and redundancy  as i look at hardware i cant believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware  its amazing  as for parts what do you think about ordering from the cheapest us source and paying duty   

coffee or lunch would be great  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today but things are very slow and im more or less available any time  whenever youre next in town give me a buzz or if youre looking for a reason to come into town how about tuesday or wednesday  lunch or an afternoon coffee
 

id have to see them and theyd have to fit my shoes but as long as the discount is in the 8590 range 
im cool with it
 

i only just started playing squash are you a member at the y  do you want to meet around 330 or so

i dont know what you mean  im just a dumb trader

its called double mo cafe  go to wwwdoublemocafe
 

i missed yoga last night too  do you want to try to yim this weekend  saturday night sounds good  im not sure whats going on with crantina and its not too personal nor a secret  ill pass the book along to jai  are you working at earls again this we to support your shooterlifestyle   c 
 

3 to 1  the games were close but carlos controlled the match
 

dear elissa

its great to hear from you and im pleased you thought of my on your christmas list  it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball  oops  i hope you are well and happy new year to you too  i am still working for name a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently  things are ok with that for the moment but i dont really know whats in my future  probly know more soon  i live in calgary did you know and have for the last year or so  i like canada very much  much more than i expected although it is very cold here  mostly the people i like especially but not limited to all the comely young women  

are you still in nc  are you going to make name a respectable man anytime soon  

i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work although i hesitate to call it that since i do very little all day  i had a good time back home went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks which felt ok  its been awhile since ive been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing  

i wish you had sent one of those generograms in your holiday card so i would know what youre up to  send a note when you get a chance  

also if you can think of it reply to trycooperhotmailcom as im better at keeping in touch from home  

one big hug
cooper
 

hey emily

dont think i can make yoga tonight  i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so im going to chill out for a few days  however i have made plans to see the royal ts with dorland tonight  so heres a look if you havent already seen it  

and to respond to your earlier email i cant keep up
the meeting i had on sunday was fine  its always good to see what else is out there  

the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating  i cant wait until youre an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake  and speaking of earls desserts anything would be better than the gingerbread cake  also has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu specifically the featured ingredients section  

not sure when youre going to get this actually  

oh im going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if youjamie are interested  do you interested in wine  my friend craigs wife owns the cafe which is near the university  i always have fun when i go so give it some thought if you like wine  i think its going to be a new zealandaustralian theme  

	 c 
 

hope this one gets thru
 

the first  just wanted to go thru whatever i was thinking last night  its no big deal
 

name


i need to get whatever access name and name had to albertapower and albertagas databases on dev and prod

i may already have it but im not sure especially about the albertagas database  

basically their accounts have been cleared from the network and i need to run things under my own account 
rather than theirs  

also on dev db i need to admin rights as name had these to do some olap stuff  im guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this  

cooper
 

i think she said going steady
 

try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and appear busy  i know what you mean in some ways its harder when youre not used to not doing things  ive gotten good at finding things to do with my time but when i first had nothing to do i was going crazy  fridays are always slow around here and im guessing its the same there although i dont know cnrl specifcally oil and gas producermarketer  

in terms of what i do before enron went under i was the short term alberta power trader  since then i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an everwidening circle  although things are looking up  

eze is i think an earls nickname  pronounced easye  although they may just call her easy for short  im sure she loves both names very much  

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that  should i call ezes cell  or do you have a cell 
 

nice work getting her email address bitch
 

i can come now  what are  you doing for lunch
 

hey do you see graphics above this sentence  the admins showed me how to insert clip art into email and im trying to figure out if works outside of enron

hi

im responding to an email sent by name callahan on nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization  i also left a voicemessage for you  

im in the calgary office and paid out of the us  ive been operating under the assumption that i 
wouldnt get hit twice on income taxes as there is a credit between canada and the us  however after doing some reasearch on the irs website it seems there may be a cap to the credit that is allowable  do you know anything about this or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters  

thanks
 

eze

hows the new job  

i got your email from jai  are we on for yoga tomorrow  

thanks for the scooby snacks tasty and stickers plentiful  normally i suffer some angst from stickers since i dont want to waste them but you got me so many that its not an issue  did you have fun at the crazy horse  i was quite drunk and unfocused but had a good time  

	the edge
 

are you talking about the sweatbands in there  those are sweet  are you ordering anything from there
 

were on for 530
 

have you told nicole about going to yoga tonight

keep in mind that whatever you tell her seems to go straight to dorland and then i have to deal with it  now he wants to pull an earls at joeys here downtown
 

how about mon eve then  im not sure how much time you have  sounds like you still have work to do before going home but im up for anything  dinner or drinkscoffee later on  or maybe something more seasonal  i dont know if you still have any shopping left but i always leave it to the last minute and do a horrible job  
 
im running around today but ill try phoning tonight to see what you think

hi emily

i left fairly quickly on friday night  sorry i didnt say goodbye  i was in a strange mood maybe being sick and drunk  anyway i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends  

why dont we go to yim instead of the space  im happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him  i think janice wants to come too  

congratulations on passing all of your courses  i found graduating to be somewhat anticlimactic  i wish you had a ceremony to go to but maybe things are different in canada  

i finished reading tuesdays with morrie  great book  its good to be reminded of certain things in life  

i did get your call last night but deleted your home number  i called your cell but no one answered and there was no voice mail for some reason  can you send on your home number   

	 c

hi name
 
im deeply concerned about all of these points and think we should meet in person to discuss  im free all day
 

hey

i dont have your phone number at work  i have some bad news  ill be flying out 3 days 
later than i told you before  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight
i think it got lost on the internet some where but i cant even remember what airline it was
on so its impossible for me to check  just booked a one week flight and ill be coming 
out on the 19th  im still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little
which is good  

by the way if you havent already gotten me something i thought of a xmas present  
a squash raquet  lots of people play here and im looking to get into it   

number here is 403 974 6946 if you want to chat

hi name

how was ceilis  

i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black hawk down  i think i was in bed by 1030  im sure you had more fun than me  overall my we was fairly uneventful you

should go another time  

cooper
 

eze  i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight  i went to core last night and it was nice and mellow  do you have any idea who teaches the 730 class  i went a while back and it this hyperactive guy taught the class and it wasnt so good  adding that to the rockne risk makes it a dangerious proposition  

do you happen to have janices email address  jai and i havent been to earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing  if you see her when youre working tell her i said hi  

	 c 
 

auntie

i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns  sitting on my ass for two months has been a nice distraction but its gotten really boring  trading is exciting and im looking forward to it  should be like jumping into a cold pool  im actually doing real work lately which is great  i still have no idea what you do at work  anything interesting  

yes the new babe lair should be sweet  well need aunties recommendations  just make sure you shit in jais toilet  it might be harder for you than me but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way to get your message across  as a woman i think it would send an especially clear signal  are you stopping by this weekend  im having a couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2 so i think well be around then for sure  

5 times a day is no problem but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a push but with the right stimulation anything is possible  is chrissy a 5x7 kind of chick  wow  and of course retention is always an interesting experiment  

well have to go to big wallys  especially if its not my style  i havent spent much time in kensington but it seems like there are some good spots there  

	 c 
 

it says its general admission are there no seat assignments  do you want to go sat or sun
 

at some point you will stop demonizing emily and rerealize how cool she is bitch

heres your chance to get out with your rep intact you can blame everything on the complexity

i would make it clean though none of your halfassed bullshit

hey mike

cooper
 

not sure  i have to do a walk thru on my old apartment at 3 and probly come back to work after that  what are you thinking
 

this is from my old girlfriend that i hooked up with over break  i think i should call eh
 

cell number is  512 3312 but its enrons phone so 

home number is 262 0205 and cooperllamacomcom should be a good place to reach me

as for me im very unsure  im still technically a us employee and my visa expires soon 
so i really dont have any idea  

worst case is i take a welldeserved vacation for awhile and worry about the rest later    

cooper
 

hey

sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me  

i missed you at thanksgiving as well  canadians celbrate thanksgiving
in october but some friends had me over for american thanksgiving
so i had a good time anyway  

im hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays  im planning on
being on the east coast from dec 16  jan 3 mostly in northern va  are you
going to be in bethesda at all  also planning a trip up to ny  

yes enron is in a bad way  im doing fine but it hasnt been a pleasant 
month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the
company  ive resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems
to be working  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows  

let me know about your holiday plans  

love

hi jill

ah i dont think youll get this until next week but maybe youre checking your email on the road  hope your course is fun  

how was it to see your family  ive had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around  i feel like im back in high school when im back home i think or something like that  

dont tease me what did you do on sat night  

work is going really well  finally feeling some pressure  

hmm i dont know anything about painting pottery but im interested ive done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile but could be fun with the right group of people  

talk to you soon
cooper
 

well after your pep talk this morning  its worth checking out for sure
 

probly around 2 or after work around 430
 

dont think so  hes pretty old
 

ill be in this powerpool meeting from 930 to 200
 

wanted to send you a reference to my dream girl

scroll down to the julie osborn section

i used to work with her in berkeley
 

how do you feel about a matinee bitch
 

i have them back at my old apartment i think  is your battery dead
 

i think you didnt let it run long enough after your boost  i think 30 minutes is the rule of thumb when youre battery is drained  not turning over at all is not a good sign  one thing you can do is park on a hill when youre in doubt and then you can rollstart your jeep if you have a standard if you didnt let it charge long enough  if the battery is really really dead though this wont work  wheres your jeep now
 

you hooked me up on nacalsqws001d
 

auntie

what are you having at burger inn  

it has been too long  well have to fix it  what are you doing this we  

i feel like ive been sick for two weeks and i havent been doing much mostly taking care of errands etc since i dont have much to do at work these days  hopefully that will be changing soon  

um chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone  

im not sure why lucky sucked  i think it was the crowd we met up with there  you two should have come and it would have been more fun im sure  

 c 
 

dont worry im certainly not blaming you for any of this i have a short fuse when it comes to name it
 

hey name

not sure what you guys are up to likely making yourself pretty for potential investors  

were not quite at that point yet here so things are very slow which has given me some
time to look into r been on my list for quite some time  it looks very good  have you
had a chance to look into it  id like to verify that its worth putting some time into  

hope things are going well and ill give a call to chat sometime soon

t
he first detailed allegations that name
abused marktomarket accounting to
hide wholesale trading losses have
emerged in congressional testimony provided
by a professor and former derivatives
trader who reviewed the name case
for senate governmental affairs committee
those charges along with allegations
that have surfaced that marktomarket
accounting was misused by name
energy services the companys retail
energy and services unit are expected to
support the push by accounting rulemakers
for much more disclosure on marktomarket
accounting practices and the
impact of marktomarket accounting on
earnings trading firms earnings
in testimony thursday before the
senate governmental affairs committee
last week name partnoy of the university
of san name law school said it
appears that name traders mismarked
forward curves and manipulated the
amount of profits and losses that would
be reported in financial statements
in a nutshell it appears that some
name employees used dummy accounts
and rigged valuation methodologies to create
false profitandloss entries for the derivatives
name traded said partnoy who
reviewed the case over several weeks at the
committees request it appears that name
traders selectively mismarked their forward
curves typically in order to hide losses
traders are compensated based on
their profits he observed so if a trader
can hide losses by mismarking forward
curves he or she is likely to receive a
larger bonus
partnoy said mismarking forward
curves was not the only problem
for each trade he testified a
trader would report either a profit or loss
typically in spreadsheet format these
profitandloss reports were designed to
reflect economic reality frequently they
did not instead of recording the entire
profit for a trade in one column some
traders reportedly split the profit from a
trade into two columns the first column
reflected the portion of the actual profits
the trader intended to add to names current
financial statements the second column
ironically labeled the prudency
reserve included the remainder
partnoy told the committee that in
his estimation names prudency
reserves did not depict economic reality
nor could they have been intended to do
so instead prudency was a slush fund
that could be used to smooth out profits
and losses over time the portion of profits
recorded as prudency could be used
to offset any future losses he said
he recommended that investigators
question name employees who were
involved in these transactions to get a sense
of whether my summaries are complete
alleged name abuses of marktomarket accounting emerge
 

stu said he would get with chip

hey just checking to see if you spoke with  randy how was the circus
 

ena had a term supply contract with energen to purchase roughly 4485mmbtu a day at 260 on mrt which energen terminated on december the 4th 2001  the operator for the supply name field services erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between dec 431 ena also failed to remove its nomination for the supply allowing it to continue to flow to enas market oneok  name field services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ena the gas at a price of 23375 gas daily average for mrt west leg 

i have spoken with name eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ena receiving and delivering the gas to oneok

 i would like to try to get the mrt issue settled as soon as possible for i feel that it would help facilitate the centana storage account approximately 2500000 in positive cash flow although name recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues they seem to be taking their time
 

if you are in town i would like to set up a meeting sometime today to finalize the document

california changes stance on refunds two sides far apart in energy talks

california officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate 43 billion in longterm electricity contracts that the state signed this year 
gov gray name d said part of the 89 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the longterm contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for name 
weve made suggestions weve offered various ways in which people could get us 89 billion name told the san name mercury news in a report yesterday you can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money however you want to do it its just got to net out close to 89 billion 
the new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a california settlement being conducted in washington by federal energy regulatory commission judge name l wagner jr according to sources close to the negotiations 
yesterday wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if california officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise 
what im trying to do is get people in a settlement mood wagner told reporters in the event were unable to do that friday at some point i may offer a preliminary assessment the settlement conference is set to conclude on monday 
wagner fercs chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy mountainous energy prices have bankrupted california s largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put name at swords point with generators that help keep the states lights on 
last friday wagner rebuked names chief representative name kahn chairman of california independent grid operator  the states power grid manager  indicating that the states demand for nearly 9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said 
wagners settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media 
wagner complained last month that kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a dow jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks 
but he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by reliant energy inc name energy services name energy and southern co for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said the suppliers have offered to refund 600 million provided the state is able to call off various california lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said 
wagners leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to fercs commissioners ferc has tentatively called for 124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of california s electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe 
names tactical change offering to make the longterm contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals 
california s energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on shortterm power purchases at volatile spot market prices when energy costs shot upward last summer so did the states electricity bills 
in response names aide s name name and his staff began negotiating longterm power contacts with suppliers the 43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about 70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years 
thats well under the average of 250 per megawatthour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices  and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say 
a new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on name and focus settlement negotiations away from the states controversial demand for the 89 billion refund name will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to wagners negotiations 
industry supporters say names refund figure is impossible to justify theres no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said name zenger california director of cambridge energy research associates 
the states advocates counter that if ferc enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the 9 billion figure 
its not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said name wolak a name university economist who heads an oversight committee for the california grid 
those polaropposite views have left both sides in wagners conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said

governor wants to cut costs of power 
tough sell for name as suppliers balk 
by name geissinger
sacramento bureau 
sacramento  with an economic perfect storm and an election looming gov gray name wants to renegotiate several of the states expensive longterm power contracts  a move that could translate into a big break for californians 
but the generators who signed the multibilliondollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state 
if the politicians were to make all these contracts go away  who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any new contracts asked name cartwright president of san namebased calpine corp a major supplier of california power 
and many experts and analysts are skeptical about name chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state which in turn supplies california customers through various utilities 
good luck former republican gov name name sarcastically declared upon hearing of the democratic governors plan 
name however has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly powersupply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit 
the outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years perhaps decades 
this could save billions of dollars said name heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights one of the consumer groups that has embraced name power contract renegotiation plan 
name goode name legal affairs secretary said the administration is not targeting every contract because the pacts have been extremely valuable in keeping the market stable 
the governors aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies whose contracts dont require them to reopen negotiations with the state 
the governor signed more than 50 longterm contracts  worth more than 40 billion  with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year 
the state made shortterm purchases to supply california after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities then entered the longerterm pacts that provide about a third of the states power demands the contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years 
though the contracts provide power at an average 69 per megawatthour over the next decade the current market has dropped to less than half that rate and the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times forcing california to sell the excess at multimilliondollar losses 
the longterm contracts harshly criticized by republicans seeking the gop gubernatorial nomination have become a political liability for name as he heads into a reelection bid next year 
the liability is compounded due to the pacts potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at name university termed a brewing perfect storm of fiscal calamities 
the state public utilities commission principally citing a desire for less costly power has refused to allocate a revenue stream  generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds  to finance the longterm contracts 
the standoff has pitted name and democratic state treasurer name angelides against another of the states most powerful democrats senate leader name name of san name who sided with the democraticcontrolled puc 
name has called for californians to be freed from egregious unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts 
the deadlock is holding up a 125 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund californias future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency shortterm electricity purchases it would be the largest municipal debt sale in us history 
without the bond issue a projected general fund deficit of up to 14 billion next year could grow to a staggering 20 billionplus forcing draconian cuts in essential government services according to state finance officials 
the projected deficit of up to 14 billion in californias annual budget of about 100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy further chilled by the sept 11 terrorist attacks on the east coast 
against the backdrop of fiscal woes analysts said successful renegotiation of some longterm power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing californians electricity rate hikes tax increases or both 
but some analysts are pessimistic like name the former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis and yet he in turn blames name for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes 
the western power trading forum a group representing suppliers and brokers has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers 
were not going to say no wed certainly sit down at the table with them and say lets see maybe we can do this maybe we can do that said calpines cartwright 
if state officials simply broke some of their contracts not only would penalties be very very severe but also they would have completely blown their credibility and no one would negotiate with them cartwright said 
his comments coincided with reports that calpines thirdquarter profits more than doubled despite a sharp drop in shortterm electricity prices in california one of its main markets analysts said calpines performance can be largely attributed to its longterm contracts with the state 
heller one of the states most vocal consumer advocates said name is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate or even throw out many of the contracts 
last spring heller said power companies had a gun to the governors head and with staff that already had conflicts of interest the administration signed some terrible deals
 

pge called  they want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their por that theyll be filing with ferc around november 30th  they want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks please let me know if youre interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested  thanks

see story below

state completes historys largest municipalbond sale 
californias treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in us history tuesday  a 57 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the states energy crisis 
the sale  coming in an environment of recordlow interest rates  also proved to be the cheapest such shortterm financing by the state on record 
and it provided a backdrop for a warning from state treasurer name angelides that continued delay in the longawaited 125 billion energybond sale could wreak havoc with the states budget in the next fiscal year 
with the sept 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins july 1 2002 
the slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis could force draconian budget cuts angelides said 
we were already facing tough budget times in 20022003 he said and that was before the tragedy of sept 11 
now if falling revenues are added to the 6 billion hole well have deficits akin to the early 1990s angelides said noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services 
earlier this year the state advanced 62 billion in generalfund money to buy wholesale power for customers of pacific gas and electric co southern california name and san name gas  electric co 
repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the 125 billion in energy bonds  a transaction angelides said requires key approvals from the state public utilities commission 
the huge energybond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late october or early november 
but the plan before the puc has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities 
with utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks puc president name lynch said tuesday 
this year weve been taken to court probably five times more than weve been taken to court last year partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because its been trying to make them so fast she said 
but angelides said that given the delay in puc action he is doubtful an energybond sale can occur before 2002 
besides raising the budget concerns that also could mean that california misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment 
i do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year he said citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow puc action 
tuesdays bond sale to meet the states cashflow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes 
the notes are fixtures on californias cashflow landscape in 199394 for example the state sold 8 billion through multiple offerings no such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus 
but a year earlier in fiscal 19992000 1 billion in notes were sold to meet cashflow needs 
besides being the largest municipalbond sale on record tuesdays sale was also the largest muni and corporatebond issuance since the terrorist strikes 
tuesdays debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers 
it speaks to overall quality of the states credit and the way the state is perceived particularly in light of sept 11 said name taylor senior vice president in the los angeles office of lehman bros 
as senior manager on the sale taylor and lehman bros coordinated participation of more than 20 investmentbanking firms 
there was wide acceptance from a range of investors retail buyers momandpop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations taylor said 
the level of orders exceeded the offering by more than 2 billion that allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 225 level initially proffered to the lowest ran on record in the state an annualized 222 percent 
the notes mature june 28 2002 overall yield counting the variablerate portion of the issuance is only 217 percent 
had the 62 billion in generalfund money been repaid angelides said the need for tuesdays shortterm debt issuance would have been substantially less  if not eliminated 
even so angelides said the state was fortunate to move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year

related party crashers sec looking into possible conflict on interest at
name

by name taub

the securities and exchange commission has requested that name provide
information regarding certain related party transactions 

we welcome this request said name l lay name chairman and ceo in a
prepared statement we will cooperate fully with the sec 

name north americas biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and
electricity noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys
reviewed the related party arrangements the board was fully informed of and
approved these arrangements and they were disclosed in the companys sec
filings we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in
connection with these transactions was considered and done lay added 

as we noted on friday a limited partnership organized by chief financial
officer name fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits
from transactions conducted with the energy company according to the wall
street journal the partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals
with name in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk
of losses 


report ey revenues nearly halved
later this week ernst  young will announce that its revenue growth was
nearly halved in the fiscal year ending june 30 according to the financial
times 

specifically the big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues
rose by 72 percent to 99 billion for the year in fiscal 2000 revenues
climbed by 141 percent and by 135 percent the prior year 

the reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that ey fetches most of
its business from the united states and the us economy tanked in the
first half of this year 

we have been successful this year despite the economy and during a period
of great challenge and change in our profession chairman name turley told
the ft 

rival andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year
through august 31 

another reason for eys revenue retrenchment the strong dollar the firm
is expected to announce that revenues increased 124 percent in local
currency terms according to the paper 

turley told the ft that his clients are less focused on the longer term and
are instead concentrating on watching expenses cash management debt
covenant issues and security concerns were going to see more covenant
violations and that will drive restructuring issues turley told the ft

a few thoughts
conference calls on issues of this size dont generally seem very constructive and id suggest that we push for a facetoface with name
if the legislature doesnt get the mou out well in advance of september 14th name wont be focused and id suggest that we try and reschedule
no matter the forum the proposal will be tough to get through even though it makes alot of economic sense  its a big change and big changes dont come easy no matter the benefits  that said no shots no ducks  we ought to make a push
the proposal may not be contingent on legislation it might be possible to make it happen at the california puc
assignment to dwr would be significant and might require legislation need to ask a qf lawyer
the proposal makes sense for both the ious and dwr since both want as much headroom as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements
given the pending rate agreement between the ca puc and dwr and the utilities messedup financial position dwr is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective
all that said none of the above matters much unless the utility a critical mass of qfs and the pucs consumer advocate ora buy into the idea
id propose that we continue with name if name bites then go jointly with name to persuade the qfs if the qfs bite then go jointly with name and qf to try to persuade ora
on the issue of sleeving through the iou or dwr it seems useful to remain flexible on that though absent general support from the ious qfs and ora the entity will be academic

some preliminary thoughts  happy to discuss further

 calpine benefiting from california energy crisis official says
 by name taub


 san name california aug 28 bloomberg  calpine corp a california
 power producer has benefited from the states energy crisis by locking in
 very favorable margins on longterm electricity sales senior vice
 president name macias said

 about 90 percent of the electricity calpine is generating this year is
being
 sold under longterm agreements to the state macias said on a conference
 call with analysts a year ago about 30 percent of calpines power was
 under contract he said

 calpine one of the largest us powerplant builders has been buying

heres a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with direct access please let  us know if the list looks about right

fyi  name and i are scheduled to travel to portland to sit down with name swain  co in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks

finally note that though the risks listed below are linked to puc actions the california legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks  for example the legislature could pass a bill directing the puc how to allocate costs associated with the utilties undercollection the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power dwrs long term contracts etc 

best
name
  
1	retroactive suspension of da contracts  the puc rules in a subsequent decision that da is suspended on some date 	between july 1 and september 20th  

2	contract renewal forbidden  the puc includes contract renewal under the suspension of da

3	no incremental dasring  the puc includes incremental additions and subtractions of da customers load under the 	suspension of da eg fast food chains university campus

4	cost allocation the puc adds new costs to da accounts andor disproportionately shifts existing costs to da accounts  	costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to da customers include iou undercollection bonds to repay the state general 	fund and dwr contracts  the costs associated with these categories are substantial 

additional suggestions from name day

5	dasr processing   if the utilities attempt to implement the commissionordered suspension in an onerous way it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 092001 but not yet dasrd

6	confidentiality of contract information  the utilities andor the puc may require esps to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 092001

power providers cry foul over fees 
state is accused of improper billing 
electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating californias energy market are turning the tables on the state saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by gov gray name administration 
the power traders accuse the independent system operator  which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager  of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of highpriced electricity contracts 
energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency said jan smutney jones of the independent energy producers association which represents such industry giants as name dynegy name and reliant 
the charges showed up around the time the state department of water resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of 69 per megawatt hour for as little as 1 per megawatt hour 
the iso seems to be following specific instructions the department of water resources is giving them smutneyjones said 
an industry source said nrg energy inc and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the federal energy regulatory commission which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged 
the commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency 
state officials bought power under longterm contracts when it appeared california could suffer serious power shortages over the summer instead the state had more than enough power and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy california had bought 
name ackerman of the western power trading forum an industry group said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to bury some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators 
the state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity and they control the governing board of the iso ackerman said 
the governors spokesman name maviglio called the power firms accusations absolutely false and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in washington to interfere with the states affairs 
the generators know theyll get a much better deal at ferc headquarters in washington than they will in sacramento maviglio said it shouldnt be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement 
name hidalgo a spokesman for the department of water resources said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in californias energy crisis 
i dont feel sorry for them one bit hidalgo said they had one heck of a year 
name fishman spokesman for the iso said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations 
energy trade organizations said they suspected the iso of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs 
the extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers bills for iso operating costs which all electricity sellers in california share ackerman said 
some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power others say the grid operator orders them to activate standby power units on tooshort notice when they cant comply they say the iso brings highpriced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost 
the accusations are part of a struggle for control of californias grid in january name disbanded the isos 26member governing board which was chaired by smutneyjones after some critics said it was too cozy with industry name appointed his own fivemember board 
in february thenferc chairman name hebert said the new board had become a political arm of the governor the commission is trying to get california to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization 
name has warned washington to keep its hands off the iso
 

just wanted to make sure that you have seen the announcement about the move the meeting on the 18th theyre having to explain and the brief description  if not let me know and ill fax it to you  and unless you have any objections im seriously considering attending the meeting since this has been one of the biggest problems weve had in the gas industry in california  let me know

battle lines drawn over longterm power deals 
sd union tribune 100701
in a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the california public utilities commission as the focus 
this time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a longrunning crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs 
in a span of three hours last week the fivemember panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business 
consumer advocates celebrated when the puc refused to rubber stamp statenegotiated longterm power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases 
but business leaders and the governor cheered the puc for approving a 33 billion rescue of southern california name which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout 
as massive as the name deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of sdge than the second reality that emerged last week despite the puc action on the contracts californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity 
or maybe not 
while electricity providers continue to defend the longterm power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled 
critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through longterm deals 
duress alleged
consumer advocates say the longterm contracts bind california to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need 
we should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said name ahern a senior analyst with consumers union the publisher of consumer reports magazine we did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal 
ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation 
name shames executive director of the utility consumers action network in san name notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in california 
the state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts shames said the motivation to do so could grow soon he added 
especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts shames said 
shames noted that the federal energy regulatory commission pressed california to lock up much of its power under longterm contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on shortterm purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis 
now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the shortterm crisis shames said 
beyond the growing political pressure san name attorney name aguirre is arguing in appellate court that gov gray name overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the longterm agreements in the first place 
he says californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices 
to circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging there were other means to manage the emergency 
the puc also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period 
first and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said name cohen general counsel for the puc
willingness to deal
at least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter cohen said the puc also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with ferc 
the federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable ferc is considering refunds for prices paid by california in spot power markets during the crisis 
cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds longterm contracts should be subject to similar relief the puc has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from ferc 
for his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts 
in order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said name maviglio the governors spokesman we would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate but we have not been approached by anyone 
some experts believe name wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements the same people speculate that the governor who blasted the puc last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements 
power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements 
the contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said name highlander director of public relations for calpine corp 
the san name company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within california 
sempra says contract fair
the company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said highlander and he declined to say how calpine would respond to such an overture 
san namebased sempra energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state 
name niggli president of sempra energy resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices 
its pretty tough to say lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  niggli said 
but v name white director of the center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies said sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from nonrenewable sources 
white says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing 
there are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to white said the generators say nobody asked us the governor says nobody has volunteered 
but the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate why dont we ask 

state authority buying more power for 2002 
critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
oc register 100701
sacramento  californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices 
moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power  because of existing contracts and conservation  to get through the hottest of summers next year 
the new power purchases which are being negotiated by the california public power and financing authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to california  enough for about 23 million homes  by june that would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in longterm agreements the state has already inked with power generators 
many observers  even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state  are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run 
were dumping power and authority chairman name name is buying more power whats up with that its absolutely ludicrous said name snyder executive director of consumers union which publishes consumer reports 
a draft report by the california energy commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year 
without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion that is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are 
in a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus 
power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer the more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state treasurer name angelides an authority board member 
said name we are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer that why we get paid the big bucks 
new contracts would increase green power 
in addition at least onethird of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy  1000 megawatts  would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said 
such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent the longterm goal is 17 percent 
the remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from socalled peaker plants  less efficient jetenginelike generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages 
the emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers while not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service if california can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes 
nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts they note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio that assessment wont be done until february 
i hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said name goldberg a lobbyist for the utility reform network a consumer watchdog group 
businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
even the states businesses are critical 
they believe that the more expensive longterm power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there 
lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate 
lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system 
i would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said name name president of the california manufacturers and technology association 
the state power authority was signed into law in may to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies leading the 5 millionayear agency is name the former head of the los angeles department of water and power and one of name closest advisers during the energy crisis 
the legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month 
its not an investigation said assemblyman name keeley dname chairman of the joint legislative audit committee but its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law 
keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state 
name said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work 
the plain truth is we had blackouts last winter we did what we could we kept the rates stable and lights on name said criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight

fyi  long piece criticizing the forbes article criticizing name  not bad
 

the california puc
name lynch held a press conference in sacramento today to discuss changes to the commissions previously released proposal regarding direct access and the rate agreement between the puc and dwr
in the amended proposal discussed and distributed today direct access would end retroactive to july 1  customers with contracts executed as of july 1 would would remain direct access customers

the legislature
the assembly version of the senate mou sb 78 has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the committee
it is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 630 pm pdt today
amendments on direct access were released this afternoon based on negotiations between name office and business customers
customers who have consistently been da since may 2000 including those involuntarily returned to bundled service would be exempt from charges for names undercollection dwrs forward contracts and dwrrelated exit fees provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for names remaining customers
customers who have consistently been on da between may 2000 and jan 17 2001 would be exempt from charges for names undercollection dwrs forward contracts and dwrrealted exit fees provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for names remaining customers
customers who have been on da between jan 17 2001 and august 24 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to dwr forward contracts provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for names remaining customers
customers leaving after august 24th would not qualify for exemptions
there is considerable work underway to make the august 24th date the deadline for contract execution rather than the date by which the customer must be dasrd in order to qualify for the exemptions
direct access would not be suspended however until 90 days after the bill is signed by name if he signs it ie the effective date of the bill
so anyone going to direct access between aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions
after the 90day period da would be suspended until 1103
selfgen in service consistently from may 200 to august 24 would be exempt from names undercollection and dwr charges
selfgen that submitted an application to the energy commission by august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the selfgen comes on line
selfgen that comes on line after august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the selfgen comes on line but the total number of exempt mws in this category would be limited to 250 mws per year on a firstcomefirstserve basis
at least 30 of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen

fyi  some interesting tidbits from cmta
 

below is an update from the weekends activities

the group negotiating the corenoncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative languageformat  
the product produced thus far is generally sloppy and illdrafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today he will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow pdt
the plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to hertzberg by cob tomorrow monday
as expected some in the group are attempting to recontract certain portions of the original deal but those attempts are generally at the margin
the dwr contracts remain a key impediment to any deal
senator name has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to name
in addition the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by dwr and delink the bonds from the dwr contracts may be on a slower track than folks thought initially

name devises new borrowing plan 
his executive order could speed up 125 billion in bond sales and bypass puc oversight of repayment mechanism 
sacramento  gov gray name is crafting a new plan to expedite the longdelayed borrowing of 125 billion to repay the sagging california state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis 
the plan  which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week  would minimize the role of the states top power regulator the public utilities commission which enraged name last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan 
with enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two states largest utilities the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis 
that is one scenario name spokeswoman name mclean said wednesday when asked about the proposal there are a number of different scenarios being considered nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced 
most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell 125 billion in revenue bonds most of which about 96 billion would go back into the state treasury the issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid  a critical step before they could be marketed to investors 
name wanted the puc to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the states energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers but the puc said the administrations proposal might prove inadequate over time leading to future rate hikes 
the puc also said the administrations plan gave too much authority to the namecontrolled department of water resources by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue 
the puc which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates did not want to cede that authority it rejected the name plan oct 2 on a 41 vote led by its president name appointee name lynch 
name earlier said the commissions approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market 
the plan now under review however would bypass that 
the dwr would not directly set rates but under the name plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated  in effect guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy wall street 
the administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes 
lynch said wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations but questioned whether name had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the dwr to get involved in setting rates 
ive been told for six months that the puc was needed to pass a rate agreement if the dwr can get the bonds sold by themselves then great lynch said but to dedicate rates it takes a financing order from the puc or a statutory change in law a statutory setaside it takes one of those two things 
the governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the legislatures version of the payback plan by law the governor has until sunday to act on sb18xx by senate leader name name dsan name 
name opposes names bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid followed by the energy suppliers the power companies contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority which name believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute 
if name signs the order soon the bonds could go to market early next year having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected 4 billion to 6 billion shortfall in other income

consumer groups calif puc question pwr contract validity 
los angeles dow jonestwo california consumer groups have asked california attorney general name lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the states negotiations according to a press release monday 
the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
we believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the states electricity contracts were made in violation of californias conflict of interest laws said name ahern senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law it must be set aside as void 
three weeks after budhrajas january hire date name companies wmb httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbolwmb news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbolwmb msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbolwmb won a 34 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 12 years budhraja disclosed in midaugust that his company the electric power group was paid more than 10000 by name during the previous 12 months budhraja was hired by the california department of water resources to negotiate power contracts but hasnt said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the name contract was signed 
it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the name contract ahern said it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover 
the groups also are concerned that budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a 39 billion contract with allegheny energy inc aye httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbolaye news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbolaye msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbolaye while he owned stocks in energy companies according to the release 
the attorney generals office recently said it doesnt plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations no one at the office could be reached for comment monday 
the california public utilities commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the states 43 billion in longterm energy contracts the san name chronicle reported monday 
the cpuc has argued in filings with the federal energy regulatory commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the states energy crisis to negotiate highpriced contracts according to the report the average price of power under the contracts is 69 a megawatthour more than double peak electricity prices last week

probing the palace coup 
electricity a panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the iso president 
september 26 2001 
by kimberly kindy
the orange county register 
sacramentoa state senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage californias energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices 
the investigative committee headed by state sen joe dunn dsanta name is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the capitol the palace coup 
lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events  directed by the man who heads the states energy grid  fueled the california energy crisis pushed the state into the powerbuying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers 
the central question behind the palace coup is whether terry winter the president of the independent system operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge 
winter defied his own board and gov gray name when he filed a 50page request to remove the caps records and interviews show 
i dont know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said dunn 
the subpoenas will force those involved including winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over emails personal calendars and memos 
name spokesman name maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of winter 
the governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis maviglio said 
winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office iso spokesman name fishman said dunns committee will find no criminal conduct the decision was made by iso upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on at the time generators were refusing to sell power in california because of the price caps 
it was an emergency fishman said 
we had to take action 
what became known as the palace coup began on oct 26 when iso board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power the restrictions would drive prices as low as 65 per megawatt  nearly 12 times below the 750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier 
they electricity generators grinned and beared the 750 price cap but this new plan by iso was too much said dunn whose committee has been investigating since march 
all hell broke loose 
records show that on oct 31 power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the federal energy regulatory commission demanding that the new plan be killed the letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators 
if not removed immediately the iso price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by name energy vice president name hall iii 
although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials he said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws 
in the oct 31 letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps werent removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market 
the generators got their way 
the next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan what was left in place was a 250 price cap established five months earlier 
power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldnt make a profit even under these constraints 
they began to withhold power from california and on dec 7 the iso declared its first stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted 
what followed the next day is considered by the governor and dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis 
winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the iso submitted a 50page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the 250 price cap final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government 
neither the iso board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of winters actions until the cap had been removed in fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request name robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and iso board members just hours before the filing was made he didnt mention anything about it 
in retrospect we should have told them robinson said 
with the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs 
the iso staff sat in a meeting with the governors key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment maviglio said it was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant this action accelerated the utilities move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the powerbuying business 
prices for electricity jumped from an average of 249 a megawatt to 700 a megawatt within three days iso records show 
dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded 30 billion 
robinson said the filing  granted two hours after the request  helped rather than hurt californians prices he said did not spike as a result instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas  which is used to run power plants to generate electricity 
robinson said the emergency order allowed the iso to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials 
we believe the action we took addressed a severe concern robinson said in our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation we felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund 
jan smutneyjones who was the iso board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap smutneyjones also said he was unaware of anyone in the powergenerating community being consulted 
terry did this by himself said smutneyjones executive director of the independent energy producers 
he did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing 
the iso board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding winter explain his actions some board members pushed to have winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governors spokesman maviglio said 
name j hoecker the former federal energy regulatory commission chairman defended making the december decision and also defended winter 
they filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let california go dark hoecker said 
they iso management did what any independent system operator would do 
what dunns committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired he believes memos and emails around the time of winters dec 8 actions should provide vital clues 
we dont know why he did what he did but we are eager to find out dunn said terry said he made that filing in the interest of californians but i find that argument has no basis in fact

ladwp run by name adviser cashed in on calif crisis

dow jones capital markets report via dow jones


   by name leopold
   of dow jones newswires


  los angeles dow joneson a single day in june 2000 the los angeles
department of water and power the largest municipal utility in the country
raked in 5 million selling california surplus power for 1000 a
megawatthour
 about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before

  that sale reported by the california independent system operator and
confirmed by the ladwp in an interview last june was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on californias power crisis

  on monday the department of water resources the agency that has been
purchasing californias bulk power needs in lieu of the states
cashstrapped
utilities released a detailed report of spotmarket power purchases showing
the
ladwp charged the state an average of 242 a megawatthour for power from
jan
18 through may 31 this year that price is about 35 higher than those
charged
by most of the outofstate generators gov gray name has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers

  potentially embarrassing for the name administration however is that
the
ladwp was formerly run by general manager name name who in april became
name top energy adviser

  name maviglio press secretary to name said texasbased generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the states
two
largest utilities

  anywhere they wear cowboy hats they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face because they are robbing us blind he said the bad guys are clearly
the
outofstate generators

  names trademark is a white stetson

  the former ladwp chief who last september quipped that a blind pig could
make money under californias faulty deregulation setup didnt return
calls
for comment

  name took a leave of absence from the ladwp in january to negotiate
longterm power contracts on behalf of the state

     power to sell


  according to the dwr report the ladwp brought in 331 million selling
power
to the state between jan 18 and may 31 this year

  the ladwp which didnt take part in the states deregulation debacle and
which isnt under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators also cashed
in
throughout 2000 the utility has 7000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5500 mw to serve its retail customers freeing it to sell as
much
as 1000 megawatts to the iso at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging

  the ladwp did so well that it was able to pay down 200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers rates in 2002

  it just shows you that enterprise is where you find it name said in
an
interview last year

  last july ratings agency fitch concluded that californias electricity
shortage provided ladwp an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal systems coffers

  according to a report by the iso manager of the states electricity grid
the
ladwp overcharged california for power from may 2000 through february 2001
by as
much as 20 million maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility

  on tuesday an ladwp spokesman defended the utilitys power prices saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high

  the iso has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly 9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended may 2001 on monday settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down

  other municipal utilities including the sacramento municipal utility
name
and private companies like bc hydro in canada have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to california at the last minute

campaign funds will pay for spots 
name salladay chronicle sacramento bureau
saturday july 7 2001 
2001 san name chronicle 
sacramento  gov gray name will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis  further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport 
name political adviser name south said the ads are designed to fill an information void among californians about what the state has accomplished but they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of tv ads financed by republicans and power companies are attacking name 
the campaign season has started early said name stutzman a consultant with the state gop which has not been involved with the antiname tv spots running since june 19 
name 60second radio spot takes the form of an energy update where the governor informs listeners that we have licensed 16 new power plants including three name opened this month and that conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices 
name ads convey the same information as a series of statefinanced flex your power ads run by the department of consumer affairs only those ads dont mention name name campaign fund worth well above 25 million is paying for the 150000perweek radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions 
south dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the tv ads that make name a target saying the governors poll numbers are actually going up he said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous particularly one showing name in red square 
one of the reasons we chose this energy update tack south said is that people simply are not in the mood to have some fullout firefight and some partisan battle about this problem they are in a justthefactsmaam mood 
stutzman said he didnt disagree with south about the illtimed and partisan nature of the tv ads which are financed out of washington dc but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own 
these ads even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads very much are political ads stutzman said the reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governors voice and i dont think he has any credibility on this issue 
name already has updated his 2002 campaign web site wwwgraydaviscom which includes an oddlooking caricature of the governor and a photo of name standing with actor name sheen who plays a president on the tv show the west wing the sheen photo dominates the home page 
what were trying to do with the web site is have a little fun with it said south who declined to say whether name would run against president bush in 2004 
last month a conservative group with links to republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming name for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from grayouts 
time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking name who has accused texas firms such as reliant energy of unconscionable pricegouging 
reliant which donated 10000 to name before the energy crisis has contributed to the antiname advertising effort according to time and the american taxpayers alliance hopes to raise as much as 25 million to keep the ads running in california through july 
name name a former campaign manager for name doles failed 1996 presidential bid formed the american taxpayers alliance in washington to raise money for the 30second ads he has refused to name his donors and did not return a call for comment yesterday 
even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away republicans are worried they are losing ground in congress on bushs energy policy and name popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls 
but the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy 
name recently hired former namegore campaign and white house strategists name lehane and name fabiani and name public presence and political pull dramatically increased 
another conservative group the 21st century energy project will begin running tv ads next week in washington to promote expansion of the energy supply more drilling and nuclear energy 
the 500000 twoweek advertising purchase is being coordinated by name gillespie a former campaign strategist for bush and a consultant for names name corp the worlds largest energy trader 
gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a conservative market oriented message about energy to counteract environmental groups such as the name club he said environmentalists arent addressing the gap between supply and demand except through strict conservation 
were trying to shape the debate because its been pretty onesided so far gillespie said

hertzberg speaker of the ca assembly called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the corenoncore proposal in california  the purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for california  heres a summary of the meeting  please keep confidential

work will be done over the weekend to put the corenoncore proposal in legislative language  we will be in the room
work done by the plan b group in the assembly joe dutra and joe nation will also be put into legislative language over the weekend
because no proposal is comprehensive a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far ie corenoncore plan b name mou
in addition there are republican demands that hertzberg will need to address eg end the litigation in order to achieve bipartison support which is what hertzbergs shooting for 
to move the legislation the plan is to establish a conference committee comprised of an equal number of democrats and republicans
the committe would begin work on monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together vote it out of the legislature and send it to the governor for signing by monday july 16th
july 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the puc will issue its proposed decision regarding among other things how dwrs revenue requirement will be put into rates whether direct access needs to be suspended etc
the puc is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the commission votes on a final order on august 15th  the puc will actually issue a thought piece on monday the 9th and will use reactions to the thought piece to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th
all of this is still up in the air however  as of right now the leader of the senate name has not agreed to hertzbergs gameplan and the republicans while interested have not yet committed to join the process

pge restructuring bid draws state ire 
by dale kasler and name peyton
bee staff writers 
published sept 21 2001

in a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy pacific gas and electric co proposed a radical restructuring thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utilitys valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants 
to make the plan work pge asked a us bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing powerplant ownership  a request that triggered immediate opposition from california officials 
pge said the plan a complicated blend of asset transfers debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs would restore the utilitys financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state bailout divorcing the utility from its parent company the plan would pay off the entire 132 billion of debt pge accumulated during californias poorly executed era of deregulation 
the plan filed in us bankruptcy court in san name had the support of a key block of creditors including independent energy generators whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan 
but it ran into immediate opposition from gov gray name and other state officials setting up a potentially fierce battle despite pges claims to the contrary they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because pge could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants the proposal would have the state public utilities commission relinquish control over those plants to the federal energy regulatory commission 
ferc has proven over the last 18 months to be  no friend of the ratepayer name told reporters thursday the puc while far from perfect has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the federal energy regulatory commission  im very wary of pges proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a nonregulated environment 
the puc vowed to fight the plan in court i dont think the judge is going to do it said puc president name lynch 
consumer advocates noted that pge has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants its complete piracy said name hoge head of the utility reform network of san name its the most audacious thing ive ever seen 
filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection the plan calls for pge to be spun off from pge corp but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent 
that would violate a state law passed as a response to the energy crisis prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006 the law was intended to keep electricity in california hands at a time when outofstate generators were charging ultrahigh prices to pge and southern california name 
pge acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court  a federal entity  to override the state law legal experts said its not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law and in prior rulings us bankruptcy judge name montali has sided with state officials 
any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws said influential state sen name bowen dname del rey chair of the senate energy committee 
name d name jr pges chairman called the transfer a good deal for customers he said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about 50 a megawatt hour  the lower end of current rates  under a 12year contract 
but thats almost double the existing rates for those plants critics said 
and name cohen the pucs general counsel said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent unregulated generator 
this is more of what got us into this mess to begin with cohen said 
despite the friction between pge and the state the plan requires assurance from the puc that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers regardless of how high they go such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization pge said 
the plan also requires approval from federal officials and a yes vote from a majority of pges creditors along with montali 
name said the plan could be completed by december 2002 enabling the utility to resume buying electricity the state has been buying power for pge since january when it became insolvent 
while the puc raised rates an average of 40 percent this year the reorganization plan doesnt require another rate hike name insisted from the customers view this transaction will be seamless he said the same should be true for most employees he said 
the pge chairman whose company has feuded with name for months also boasted that pge isnt asking the state for a bailout or a rescue  a jab at name asyetunsuccessful effort to sell the legislature on a multibilliondollar rescue for name 
its unclear what impact pges proposal would have on names attempt to avoid bankruptcy names creditors already angered that the legislature adjourned without passing the namebacked plan might conclude that name is better off in bankruptcy and could push the southern california utility into court analysts said 
the pge proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current pge corp split into two separate publiclytraded companies 
the utility company pacific gas and electric would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets  including its hydro and nuclear plants transmission wires and gas pipelines  to pge corp for 406 billion in cash and ious pge corp shareholders would receive stock in the slimmeddown utility although the details of the stock transaction havent been worked out 
the bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that pge has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control the puc and legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment 
despite the criticism pge said removing those assets from regulators oversight is essential to making the plan work why because puc rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets said utility spokesman name low if the assets became property of pge corp the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts name said hes had indepth discussions with investment bankers about issuing new bonds 
also by removing the generating plants from puc oversight the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment said credit analyst name bodek of standard  poors corp in new york 
if state officials fight the plan the question arises how do you discharge these debts  bodek said heres a plan that does that 
the plan would pay creditors 91 billion in cash and 41 billion in bonds creditors with debts of more than 100000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds which will be paid in 10 or more years said name aronzon attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors 
theres some credibility here and it works aronzon said of the plan 
name ackerman a spokesman for independent generators said his group would probably accept the plan even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money 
shareholders also endorsed the plan pge corps stock jumped 122 to 1572 on a day when the markets took another bad fall
 

we continue to attempt to kill the hearing altogether  name advise with info as it happens

i think that we should pursue both  if we can convince the puc that its a good deal and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it  if the puc agrees then the rate component should cover pges concern and they should be able to go forward  thoughts

washingtoneager to exploit public dissatisfaction with president bushs approach to energy and the environment senate majority leader name daschle wants to place those issues next on the democratic agenda before other initiatives popular with democrats  daschles aides and party strategists say the senates top democrat wants to keep the white house on the defensive draw attention to popular democratic goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources and inoculate his party against republicans charges that it has ignored the countrys energy needs activists on both sides see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation bush can sign 	
	
   with summer and gas prices and air conditioning  this is what you go with said democratic pollster name yang its an issue that people actually live every day there are very few issues like that in politics  democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the white house recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way bush is handling energy and environmental issues  whats more the house of representatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and gas off floridas gulf coast and in the great lakes both measures passed with support from 70 republicans  when the republicancontrolled house soundly rejects key components of the presidents energy policy it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center said daschle spokeswoman name dunn  the decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after daschle met privately with his chairmen of key committees democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum wage hatecrimes legislation a prescriptiondrug plan for seniors and other issues popular with their supporters  but concentrating on energy policy first gives democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a republican issue and turn it to their advantage aides said  bush and vice president name cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former texas oilmen from the moment cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energy needs of the united states democrats portrayed bush and him as beholden to special interests  the white house and republicans are in the 35 percent end of public opinion on this a top democratic leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said this week its a loser every day for the republicans  with that in mind daschle and sen name bingaman the new mexico democrat who heads the senates energy and natural resources committee plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of july it will be a full scale alternative to the bushcheney program unveiled in may  the first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week when the senate debates the spending bill for the interior department republicans and white house lobbyists will have their hands full fending off democratic amendments to match the house bans on offshore drilling near florida beaches and on national monument lands  the white house helped defuse some of the oilexploration dispute earlier this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the gulf of mexico but huge disagreements remain over drilling in alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge a centerpiece of bushs energy plan some democrats intend to offer an amendment to the interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge  democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming one proposal which combines conservation and anti pollution goals would raise gasmileage requirements for sport utility vehicles the national academy of sciences is studying fuel economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to congress later this month  the energy debate also splits senate republicans giving daschle extra manpower to challenge bush democrats can count on new england republicans such as name chafee of rhode island and olympia snowe and name collins both of maine to back several democratic initiatives  sen name mccain rariz who already has opposed bush on the patients bill of rights and campaign finance legislation also has said he favors more conservation measures than the white house proposes  hell be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue said name wittman a senior fellow at the conservative name institute research center and a political adviser to mccain you can already see the outlines of that proposal  encouragement of conservation some exploration but everything is environmentally friendly  the white house already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable energy but bush restored some of the money later he also has paid more attention to energy conservation indicating support for spending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget  but the president is not backing away from his position that the united states needs to become less dependent on foreign oil and that white house officials say requires more oil and gas exploration in the united states the energy plan bush sent to congress last week would authorize drilling in the alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay for research into alternative energy sources  in addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and energy the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals rolling blackouts in california are on the wane gasoline prices are falling and last week name browne the chief executive of bp oil dismissed bushs call for new oil refineries  that gives democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions  its a target of opportunity said burdett loomis a political scientist at the university of kansas and an expert on the senate like the patients bill of rights on which the public sided with democrats energy right now is lowhanging fruit he said

two things  when aleck said that he was leaving effective immediately does that mean one cant use email to send him a note to wish him well  if thats the case do we have a forwarding telephone number for him

also just wanted to make sure youre aware that calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts  his concerns are twofold  generally he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with and specifically were tied up with allegheny sp  

ive told him that we dont like the contracts that were talking to folks about how bad they are but were staying under radar and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyones contract rights

consumer groups calif puc question pwr contract validity 
 
los angeles dow jonestwo california consumer groups have asked california attorney general name lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the states negotiations according to a press release monday 

the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies

we believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the states electricity contracts were made in violation of californias conflict of interest laws said name ahern senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law it must be set aside as void 
three weeks after budhrajas january hire date name companies wmb news msgs won a 34 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 12 years budhraja disclosed in midaugust that his company the electric power group was paid more than 10000 by name during the previous 12 months budhraja was hired by the california department of water resources to negotiate power contracts but hasnt said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the name contract was signed 

it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the name contract ahern said it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover 

the groups also are concerned that budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a 39 billion contract with allegheny energy inc aye news msgs while he owned stocks in energy companies according to the release 

the attorney generals office recently said it doesnt plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations no one at the office could be reached for comment monday 

the california public utilities commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the states 43 billion in longterm energy contracts the san name chronicle reported monday 

the cpuc has argued in filings with the federal energy regulatory commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the states energy crisis to negotiate highpriced contracts according to the report the average price of power under the contracts is 69 a megawatthour more than double peak electricity prices last week 

cpuc lawyers have filed challenges before the ferc on deals negotiated with scottish power spi news msgs unit pacificorp alliance name llc sempra energy sre news msgs and calpine corp cpn news msgs according to the report 

budhraja disclosed in august that he owned as much as 10000 in scottish power stock while a 1 billion longterm contract with subsidiary pacificorp was being hammered out the state signed the 10year contract july 6 budraha sold his stock july 30 state officials say budhraja had nothing to do with the deal according to the report

battle lines drawn over longterm power deals 
sd union tribune 100701
in a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the california public utilities commission as the focus 
this time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a longrunning crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs 
in a span of three hours last week the fivemember panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business 
consumer advocates celebrated when the puc refused to rubber stamp statenegotiated longterm power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases 
but business leaders and the governor cheered the puc for approving a 33 billion rescue of southern california name which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout 
as massive as the name deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of sdge than the second reality that emerged last week despite the puc action on the contracts californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity 
or maybe not 
while electricity providers continue to defend the longterm power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled 
critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through longterm deals 
duress alleged
consumer advocates say the longterm contracts bind california to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need 
we should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said name ahern a senior analyst with consumers union the publisher of consumer reports magazine we did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal 
ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation 
name shames executive director of the utility consumers action network in san name notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in california 
the state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts shames said the motivation to do so could grow soon he added 
especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts shames said 
shames noted that the federal energy regulatory commission pressed california to lock up much of its power under longterm contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on shortterm purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis 
now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the shortterm crisis shames said 
beyond the growing political pressure san name attorney name aguirre is arguing in appellate court that gov gray name overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the longterm agreements in the first place 
he says californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices 
to circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging there were other means to manage the emergency 
the puc also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period 
first and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said name cohen general counsel for the puc
willingness to deal
at least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter cohen said the puc also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with ferc 
the federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable ferc is considering refunds for prices paid by california in spot power markets during the crisis 
cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds longterm contracts should be subject to similar relief the puc has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from ferc 
for his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts 
in order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said name maviglio the governors spokesman we would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate but we have not been approached by anyone 
some experts believe name wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements the same people speculate that the governor who blasted the puc last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements 
power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements 
the contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said name highlander director of public relations for calpine corp 
the san name company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within california 
sempra says contract fair
the company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said highlander and he declined to say how calpine would respond to such an overture 
san namebased sempra energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state 
name niggli president of sempra energy resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices 
its pretty tough to say lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  niggli said 
but v name white director of the center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies said sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from nonrenewable sources 
white says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing 
there are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to white said the generators say nobody asked us the governor says nobody has volunteered 
but the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate why dont we ask 

state authority buying more power for 2002 
critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
oc register 100701
sacramento  californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices 
moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power  because of existing contracts and conservation  to get through the hottest of summers next year 
the new power purchases which are being negotiated by the california public power and financing authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to california  enough for about 23 million homes  by june that would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in longterm agreements the state has already inked with power generators 
many observers  even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state  are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run 
were dumping power and authority chairman name name is buying more power whats up with that its absolutely ludicrous said name snyder executive director of consumers union which publishes consumer reports 
a draft report by the california energy commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year 
without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion that is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are 
in a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus 
power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer the more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state treasurer name angelides an authority board member 
said name we are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer that why we get paid the big bucks 
new contracts would increase green power 
in addition at least onethird of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy  1000 megawatts  would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said 
such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent the longterm goal is 17 percent 
the remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from socalled peaker plants  less efficient jetenginelike generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages 
the emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers while not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service if california can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes 
nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts they note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio that assessment wont be done until february 
i hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said name goldberg a lobbyist for the utility reform network a consumer watchdog group 
businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
even the states businesses are critical 
they believe that the more expensive longterm power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there 
lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate 
lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system 
i would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said name name president of the california manufacturers and technology association 
the state power authority was signed into law in may to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies leading the 5 millionayear agency is name the former head of the los angeles department of water and power and one of name closest advisers during the energy crisis 
the legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month 
its not an investigation said assemblyman name keeley dname chairman of the joint legislative audit committee but its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law 
keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state 
name said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work 
the plain truth is we had blackouts last winter we did what we could we kept the rates stable and lights on name said criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight

quick adder  it appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments which is no surprise  utilities position is obviously extreme but it means theres likely to be a signficant fight over the issue
 

the bond legislation
the democrats in the assembly and sentate have agreed to language to create a dedicated rate component to repay the budget and delink the bonds from the dwr contracts 
but the republicans have still not agreed to go along  
the bill would require a 23s vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule so republican votes are necessary 
the republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along

using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure but how much longer is uncertain
no sense yet of when hearings on the corenoncore proposalin conference committee or otherwisewill take place though name continues to say that he wants to give it a chance

the corenoncore legislative language
the negotiating group continues to work on the language
the language was supposed to be delivered to hertzberg by cob today but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning

senator dunns investigative committee hearing
the hearings been moved from tomorrow to wednesday

its safer there
 

great question  if you think it would be useful i can back channel to name and find out  im of the view that this letter is more to refute angelides so that his wild assertions dont go unanswered in the court of public opinion  perhaps the letter should be addressed to angelides instead  

on the other hand i think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the puc has the regulatory tools processes etc necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand and ensure that theres not the sort of massive costshifting to which angelides refers on the other  in the publics view this has been painted as an eitheror issue either we end direct access or granny faces death and destruction  and thats just not the case in fact i think it can be argued that the scenario angelides paints just isnt in the cards period  

but i may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views  let me know if youd like me to find out if name thinks the letter would help her could find that out in pretty short order

riordan edges out name in field poll a survey finds lingering damage from the governors handling of the energy crisis
by name name
bee political editor
published sept 26 2001 
gov gray name survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to reelect him a field poll released tuesday found 
the poll showed name narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former los angeles mayor name riordan 45 percent to 42 percent 
riordans strength in los angeles county  rare for a republican candidate  as well as lingering damage to name from californias energy crisis were factors in the findings said the polls managing director name dicamillo 
its an interesting situation for a sitting governor he said its very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied reelection but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a democratic stronghold and also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about and thats the energy and the electricity crisis 
in a hypothetical republican primary riordan led by a large margin over secretary of state name jones 46 percent to 19 percent businessman name name trailed with 5 percent of the vote while 30 percent was undecided 
the poll surveyed 1003 californians including 722 registered voters sept 710 and is subject to an overall error margin of 32 percent 
name political adviser name south said reporting poll results taken before the sept 11 terrorist attacks on the east coast was horribly misleading 
these kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval he said these kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general 
dicamillo said he found it notable however that views of name performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis 
in may at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts voters said they disapproved of name performance 49 percent to 42 percent in the latest survey they continued to disapprove 47 percent to 41 percent 
voters also said they were not inclined to reelect name 50 percent to 43 percent 
now were in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded yet the publics image of the governor has not changed dicamillo said he has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in may 
no matter what the political temper of the times internationally there will be issues that are particular to the governors race this issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating name and its still negative 
dicamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found riordan leading among voters in los angeles county 47 percent to 43 percent he said the survey showed similar results in may los angeles county accounts for onequarter of the states electorate and democrats typically carry it and the bay area by large margins making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state 
riordan adviser name schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for name 
its clear from this poll result that the voters who know name riordan best support him most he said unless gray name plans on winning the bay area by a voice vote theres no way he can get reelected unless he turns la county around in a very big way 
south said riordan who held a nonpartisan office in los angeles will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest and he recalled that thengov name name was trailing democrat name brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for reelection 
we all know how that turned out he said a sitting california governor hasnt been defeated for a second term since 1942

based on your voicemail heres a quickanddirty synopsis of a proposal that ive been quietly discussing with a select few out here in california eg name white large customers  it could include more bells and whistles but the intent of this proposal is to get da back as soon as possible


reduce dwr lt contract volumes by at least 3350
to back fill increase in netshort created by contract reformation permit noncore customers 20 kw and above to elect to go da to fill the position
da provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than dwr contracts
election is firstcome firstserve capped at the aggregate net short position
customers decision to go da will constitute a 3year commitment to stay da ie cant go back to iou for 3 yrs must stay in the market
if a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected da ie not enough elect to fill the net short then the ious will hold an auction to fill the net short
the auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month 6 month 1 year and 3 year deals both peak and offpeak to fill the net short
noncore customers choosing da would not escape costs of dwr power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service ie prior to electing da
likewise if the noncore customers choosing da was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its undercollection ie when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing da status
noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of dwr lt contracts
potential addon to deal  core customers less than 20 kw could choose green only da but like noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible
 

dude  you guys won first even after those bad picks you made  congratz

getting alot of inquiries

the puc has not yet voted on suspension of da or related matters
likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 3060 minutes
looks as if the decision will 1 suspend da beginning sept 20th and 2 include contract renewal in the suspension  
in addition it appears that the proposal would give the commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to july 1 if deemed necessary this is unclear and were trying to get more details on this provision
three key senators have sent a a letter to the puc asking the puc to provide recommendations to the legislature on the conditions under which da should be reinstated since the letter is dated september 18ththough sent only yesterdayit appears that the senate had an idea that the puc was going to suspend

keep in mind that the decision has not been voted on yet and the provisions listed above may change

well report back as soon as something happens

given the mess out here and how long its been going on howzabout deep therapy
 

heres the proposal

there is no reason for the puc to suspend da since 1 18xx passedtherefore the bonds are taken care of all name has to do is sign the bill 2 angelides has said that moneys not an issue at least for the next several months and 3 the senate passed a resolution on friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the state of emergency put in place by name on jan 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end
the puc should therefore keep da intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable da while achieving other important objectives eg no costshifting make sure bonds get serviced etc
if however the puc rejects this rational sensible proposal and decides to suspend da then that date must not be any earlier than sept 20th and if it is we will sue

i said on this ams call that today is the deadline for name to sign or veto bills
that was not entirely correct
that deadline applies only to socalled regular session bills
the bill in question sb18xxname was passed as part of the legislatures emergency or special session
apparently emergency session bills do not fall under the october 15th deadline
name has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides
well report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the emergency session
bottom line todays deadline for regular session bills does not apply to sb18xx or to other emergency session bills

consumer groups calif puc question pwr contract validity 
los angeles dow jonestwo california consumer groups have asked california attorney general name lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the states negotiations according to a press release monday 
the utility reform network and consumers union asked lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant vikram budhraja presented a conflict of interest because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
we believe there is ample evidence for the attorney general to investigate whether some of the states electricity contracts were made in violation of californias conflict of interest laws said name ahern senior policy analyst with consumers union west coast regional office if the attorney general finds that a contract was made in violation of the law it must be set aside as void 
three weeks after budhrajas january hire date name companies wmb httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbolwmb news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbolwmb msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbolwmb won a 34 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 12 years budhraja disclosed in midaugust that his company the electric power group was paid more than 10000 by name during the previous 12 months budhraja was hired by the california department of water resources to negotiate power contracts but hasnt said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the name contract was signed 
it is reasonable to assume that budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the name contract ahern said it is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover 
the groups also are concerned that budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a 39 billion contract with allegheny energy inc aye httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbolaye news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbolaye msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbolaye while he owned stocks in energy companies according to the release 
the attorney generals office recently said it doesnt plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations no one at the office could be reached for comment monday 
the california public utilities commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the states 43 billion in longterm energy contracts the san name chronicle reported monday 
the cpuc has argued in filings with the federal energy regulatory commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the states energy crisis to negotiate highpriced contracts according to the report the average price of power under the contracts is 69 a megawatthour more than double peak electricity prices last week

calif power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
new york sept 27 reuters  california state treasurer name angelides said thursday the state could face a 93 billion budget deficit in the 20022003 fiscal year if 125 billion of power bonds are not sold before july 2002 
the treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the california public utilities commission puc into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds 
what i am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed angelides said in a telephone news conference in sacramento referring to a law passed in february setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion 
the state depleted its general fund by at least 62 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the states general fund and make future power purchases 
there can be no schedule for the bond sale until the puc completes its work angelides said 
earlier this week the puc said the muchdelayed meeting is now set for oct 2 
angelides said puc commissioner name brown one of five is on board to make the vote but president name lynch and other commissioners are not ready to act 
lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with angelides and the department of water resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement 
how the money from rate increases approved in may will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the department of water resources the authority to sell the bonds still need to be decided by the puc 
angelides is projecting a 31 billion budget deficit for the 20022003 fiscal year even if the bonds are sold in time due to reduced revenues as the overall us economy slows 
in a worst case scenario angelides added that with the bond sale the 31 billion gap may grow to 4 billion while a late sale would push the 93 billion number to 102 billion 
the treasurer painted a dire picture of california s budget if the bonds are not sold likening it to the states budget problems of the early 1990s 
angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place or possibly a 1574 per student cut in state k12 education spending 
or the state could drop all spending on the university of california and california state university and save 6 billion 
eighteen percent of the states noneducation budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold he said

state discloses spot power  buys

by name  lamar
times staff writer  


sacramento  they range from small power  sales of 922000 by the east bay municipal utility district to more than 1  billion of power sold by atlantabased mirant power company  

all told california paid 77  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the united  states during the first five months of 2001 according to a report delivered to  lawmakers monday  

the data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of 263 per  megawatthour for the power but whats most striking is the long list of  agencies both private and public that sold power to california  

agencies like the los angeles department of water  power 331 million  the california independent system operator 39 million public service company  of new mexico 126 million and pge energy trading company 24 million  

receiving the most money was atlantabased mirant which sold 12 billion of  electricity to the state january through may the secondlargest seller was  powerex a subsidiary of canadas bc hydro which earned 1 billion  

the total cost per day ranged from as little as 20 million to more than 100  million on three separate days in may when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices  

in addition the report reveals that the states energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  april and may navigant consulting inc forecast the state would have to buy  121 million megawatthours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  151 million megawatthours

if name has not collected the 33 b by the end of 2003 the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder  half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005
any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the 33 b undercollection
name can keep 10 of any refunds received after the 33b is paid off
name cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the 33b
name can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk
name will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs ie if dwrs costs go up the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of names rates
the puc will not fine name during this period if names capital structure varies from the pucapproved capital structure

calif power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
new york sept 27 reuters  california state treasurer name angelides said thursday the state could face a 93 billion budget deficit in the 20022003 fiscal year if 125 billion of power bonds are not sold before july 2002 
the treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the california public utilities commission puc into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds 
what i am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed angelides said in a telephone news conference in sacramento referring to a law passed in february setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion 
the state depleted its general fund by at least 62 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the states general fund and make future power purchases 
there can be no schedule for the bond sale until the puc completes its work angelides said 
earlier this week the puc said the muchdelayed meeting is now set for oct 2 
angelides said puc commissioner name brown one of five is on board to make the vote but president name lynch and other commissioners are not ready to act 
lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with angelides and the department of water resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement 
how the money from rate increases approved in may will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the department of water resources the authority to sell the bonds still need to be decided by the puc 
angelides is projecting a 31 billion budget deficit for the 20022003 fiscal year even if the bonds are sold in time due to reduced revenues as the overall us economy slows 
in a worst case scenario angelides added that with the bond sale the 31 billion gap may grow to 4 billion while a late sale would push the 93 billion number to 102 billion 
the treasurer painted a dire picture of california s budget if the bonds are not sold likening it to the states budget problems of the early 1990s 
angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place or possibly a 1574 per student cut in state k12 education spending 
or the state could drop all spending on the university of california and california state university and save 6 billion 
eighteen percent of the states noneducation budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold he said

puc and name settle federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
the california public utilities commission puc and southern california name name today reached a settlement in the filed rate doctrine lawsuit name filed in federal court against the puc  the settlement is intended to restore name to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers limit ratepayers costs of paying off the debt and maintain the states role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling name to pay down its back debts over a reasonable certain period of time  the terms of the settlement agreement include
	name will apply cash on hand plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs to paying off its back debt  the puc and name have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt name had at august 31 2001 less the cash on hand on that date less an additional 300 million adjustment  the amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be 3 billion as of the end of this month  the parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap
	name will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003 or on the full payment of its debt if sooner  if name has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003 the commission retains the discretion to determine whether name will pay a dividend in 2004  name is free to resume paying dividends in 2005 since names annual dividend has typically been about 400 million names shareholders will have forgone at least 12 billion in dividends and possibly more in addition to the 300 million adjustment
	name will apply 100 of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt  name commits through court order to work with the puc and the attorney general in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers
	the puc can direct name to use 150 million each year for other utility purposes including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies which would otherwise be used to pay down the name debt 
	the puc agrees not to lower names retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered  however rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced dwr revenue needs
	the puc agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate to enable name to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if names back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003 
	there are no concessions of puc or state regulations or regulatory authority over name nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities
	name may make up to 900 million in capital expenditures annually
this settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for name to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of california said name lynch president of the puc  the settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers
this agreement settles a november 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by name against the puc in which name claimed that the commissions actions in not providing sufficient retail rates violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property  under this agreement name will release the puc from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the commissions decisions implementing ab 1x ab 6x and the turn accounting proposal

the decision orders the utilities to stop accepting dasrs for contracts executed after 92001

hi name

congratulations on sidestepping what many including us thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions were as glad as anybody that it hasnt happened 

i have a quick question  your consultant for gas procurement a fellow named name baldwin until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units transwestern gas pipeline  name has informed us that we wont be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with name

with that in mind i was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than name who doesnt face the same conflict issues that we could meet with to discuss providing lowcost gas services to california  were very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflictfree environment  but it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the states consumers  if theres someone we can talk to and avoid even the appearance of conflictofinterest wed be very anxious to do so

thanks for your time and hope all is well

commissioners name m duque and name a bilas dissenting

one could say that this order is consistent with the administrations present third world country mentality we are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market

we are not convinced that the department of water resources dwr bond ratings depend on killing direct access  this notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds direct access should be seen as a benefit to dwr  it would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve dwr from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner 

something else is going on here we think that the dwr does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it will make dwrs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear the commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by dwr finance and the treasurer  instead the commission is making an ill informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later 

	dwr and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if dwr is making prudent energy purchases only if dwrs contracts are too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices indeed retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on dwr to make more prudent purchases this is a very important consideration since ab 1x prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the dwr costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds if there is no yardstick how can anyone measure dwr performance the answer is one cant unless sb 18xx is signed into law  

	we think that additional review of these issues before suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in the long run 

for these reasons we must respectfully dissent

republican minority head of the assembly electricity oversight committee the one that name wright chairs
namet recall that hes ever seen a a proutility bill that he didnt like
in fact he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry and specifically wold have locked out competition  it was strongly opposed by industry and defeated
when push came to shove i cant think of a time he didnt side with the utilities
even when the assembly republicans were doing of good job of bottling up name ridiculous bailout bills in name wrights committee pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the democrats than to foster competition
and even then he followed he didnt leadother more junior members on the committee led

got that one covered too while you were out
 

folks
here are my edits  for simplicity i accepted all the other changes and put mine in strikeoutunderline

they are confined to the direct access section and to the provisions regarding spot market service in particular  based on our negotiations i think its accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as an option to elect  instead the language in the agreement states that it is a backstop in the event that on any given day a customers esp doesnt show up with the power  in effect it retains the utilitys duty to serve like the gas side but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided  ive also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program ie the transition date the customer for whatever reason fails to elect term service or direct access service  in both cases the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days after which the customer must choose term or direct access service

please take a look at the language  while i havent put any stakes in the ground up till now i feel strongly about these changes for reasons im happy to discuss and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document id request that we have a very brief call to discuss  i believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with name

in addition ive also taken a stab at language requested by delainey ie what to do about da in the interm  there may be better ways to craft the language but i took a shot nonetheless

finally im assuming based on yesterdays call that by delivering this document to the speaker today no one is giving their approval support or anything else for each and every provision  im not prepared to and cannot do that at this time

thanks again to all for all the effort and to name for her patience in hearing me out earlier

hes going to get back to me to set up a meeting and if i dont hear from him by mondaytuesday of next week ill call him back to set up a meeting
im assuming that youd be part of that meeting
i asked him what sort of deals theyre working on as you likely know some of the contracts permit dwr to either 1 provide gas to the plant providing dwr power under the power contract or 2 manage the plants fuel supply  so theyre looking to get souptonuts supply service for those contracts that include a fuelsupply option

fyi  update on windfall profits bills
 

though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when name will call back the california legislature to address the name mou heres the latest information we have
faced with horrible polling an unwilling legislature an uncooperative california puc and a wily leader of the state senate name name is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature
rumors of a delay come despite name statements that he would call them back next week
we received the information about a likely delay from an name svp whos working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow
its names view that the earliest name would now call the legislature back is end of next week with early the following week being most likely
at this point the chance remains that name may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off leaving name to follow pge into chapter 11
in the meantime negotiations between name staff and staff from the senate and assembly continue

well report back with information as we get it

1	no im not looking for employment in the face of names current financial challenges

3	are you aware of what names going to be proposing at the puc on nov 7th wrt how it 	intends to recoup its undercollection under its settlement with the puc  in short all  	da customers irrespective of whether they were taking from name at the time that name 	accrued the undercollection would be responsible for paying  which means da customers 	would pay twice for poweronce to their esp and now again to name  is this something 	that your clients care about  we care quite a bit

one of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this or whether name wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only  we feel pretty strongly that hearings are required  one of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg ie name will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers  you have a view on whether hearings are required  more importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this and will you be there on the 7th

greetings

name everyone had a pleasant 4th

ive read the respective name and hertzberg language on amending ab 1x  the name language looks cleaner and simpler though there may be reasons to include some of the hertzberg language too

im proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill  i would appreciate your feedback  the amendments would be as follows

customers who were on direct access when dwr started buying power jan 17th and are still on direct access when the bill passes should be exempt from paying for the bonds 

in short customers should not be forced to pay for power twiceonce from their esp and once from dwr  since these customers receive power services from their esp they never consumed dwr power in the first place and it wouldnt be fair to require them to pay for it

customers who have been utility customers since dwr started buying power but subsequently switched to direct access should only pay for power provided by dwr that they actually consumed no more and no less  

for example if a customer was a utility customer when dwr started buying power but switched to direct access on may 1st then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing dwr for power deliveries that took place from jan 17th thru april 30th

i believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 45 weeks  or if we didnt explicitly agree during the talks they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now and rather than leave the issue hanging which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers i suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers obligations are  your thoughts are appreciated

in addition we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get california out of the energy hole that it finds itself in  providing 20kw and above customers with an incentive to switch to direct access as soon as possible could 1 reduce the net short position that the state and ultimately consumers have to finance thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility  2 reduce electricity purchasing costs and 3 reduce the burden on the state budget

with this in mind im also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to direct access by september 1st

finally it seems odd that the language directing the puc to suspend direct access is still in the bill  if a dedicated rate component is created that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend direct access  and if thats the case would it make sense to delete that language from the bill

look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the corenoncore proposal

name  i wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker were helping lodi to develop

the project is a peaker plant inside lodis territory with the power sold to dwr
the deal is both price and time sensitive no surprise there  needs to be on line q3q4 2002 at a price thats in line with price negotiated with dwr
for the gas interconnect your folks tell us that the project requires 811 mm in system upgrades that will take 1416 months to complete
by contrast the project could connect directly to lodis gas storage facility for about 26 mm and could be completed in about 46 months
in short pges offers blows through both the time and price constraints the lodi option accommodates both very well
we are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility
therefore 1 wed be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price irrespective of being connected directly to the lodi facility 2 wed be willing to switch over and connect with pge once the upgrades in the lodistockton area are done and 3 wed agree that the direct connection with lodi should be viewed as a special case and not precendent with the goal of avoiding exacerbating californias problems with supply shortages

thanks for listening let me know what you think

couple of additional pieces of information

in conjunction with the issue paying esps past due px amounts name has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the px credit going forward
it remains unclear whether name will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due px credit amountseg px credit contributed to undercollection and therefore da customers should help pay down the undercollection da customers must pay for stranded dwr contracts etc  
so while name is making good noises about wanting to settle which is a certainly a step in the right direction its still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter
got a call into name fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions
name report back when and if we get some answers

usa customer choice can boost green power usestudy
new york nov 2 reuters  giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade regardless of whether the market is deregulated a federal study said 
but theres a catch while 10 percent of us electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind solar and geothermal sources stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40percent goal will require more socalled green pricing programs which are often more expensive to the consumer 
according to the study pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal oil gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices indeed the study showed some customers will go green even if the price is higher than conventional sources 
market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources  giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace said blair swezey coauthor of the study 
swezey works at national renewable energy laboratory which conducted the study along with the name berkeley national laboratory both organizations are us department of energy national laboratories 
the study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products 
if competitive retail markets fail to materialize utility programs must pick up the slack said ryan wiser of name berkeley national laboratory another coauthor of the study 
california caveat 
green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition such as in california  
but in the wake of california s heavily publicized deregulation crisis the state seems to have backed away from deregulation and green power has been one of the victims 
the california experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth wiser added noting that at least until california makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation green power programs will remain on the backburner 
more than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized 
nonhydro renewables provide about 2 percent or 16500 megawatts mw of all the electricity used in the united states hydropower provides about 10 percent 
with the expansion of customer choice the study found the market could support about 6000 mw of additional nonhydro renewables over the next decade 
national renewable energy laboratory based in golden colorado is a research center for alternative fuels managed by midwest research institute technology developer battelle and global engineering firm bechtel 
name berkeley national laboratory of berkeley california  is a scientific research center managed by the university of california

	we met with name yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative ctc claim
	name continues to take a very hardline extreme position  this is it in a nutshell
1	all customersbundled and da alikecontributed to names undercollection and all customers must pay it down 
2	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and da customers contributed through the negative ctc
3	name says it will pay esps past due amounts related to the negative ctc but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer billsda and bundled aliketo recover its undercollection 
4	name intends to collect it over approximately 2 years  name estimates that the charge to da customers over this period would be about 2527mwh
5	under names plan name would likely end up paying name ie the present value of the undercollection charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative ctc payment
	obviously with respect to any settlement with name were extremely far apart and were therefore considering other 	options
	in the meantime the california puc is engaged in da and px creditrelated activities beginning next week and name 	will try to get the commission to adopt their proposal
	we are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose names proposal at the puc
	we will distribute something on monday describing our approach and tactics at the puc for folks to review and 	comment on
	we are scheduled to meet with name again next thursday to try to knock some sense into them the probability of 	which is low

puc chiefs iron resolve evident in name deal
politics insisting on her agencys independence name lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her
sacramento  once again last week california public utilities commission president name lynch gave gov gray name help that he badly neededbut left him upstaged

with the governor unable to broker a deal to save southern california name from bankruptcy lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a 33billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in los angeles on friday

although name appointed lynch as puc president she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway i will take responsibility lynch said

even as she took the lead in forging an name deal lynch defied the governor tuesday she led the puc in rejecting a measure that name and treasurer name angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year name condemned the vote as an irresponsible act

name repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act lynch however is not easily controlled she has moved ahead without the governors approval several times most notably last spring she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the puc while name was publicly opposed to a rate hike

such actions have made her perhaps name least favorite appointee

and yet lynch holds the key to resolving what now is name single most pressing issue how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since january

for months those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury unless a way is found to close it name may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection he has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a 125billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers

name would not discuss lynch for this article but his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and lynch talk only through intermediaries a top aide speaking on the condition of anonymity described the governors relationship with lynch who once served on name staff as nonexistent

but floating the bond deal requires action by the puc and name aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with lynch whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency

name could demote lynch from puc president to just commissioner but he cant remove commissioners said the name aide who described the tension between the two we are in a position where were going to have to negotiate

a yaleeducated attorney who practiced in san name before joining the administration lynch worked on name 1998 campaign helping him raise money he rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the office of research and planning then placing her on the puc in late 1999

lynch has taken seriously the idea enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the puc that the commission is supposed to be independent

she recalls spending christmas 1999 reading the public utilities code written 90 years ago and concluding that progressive gov name johnson envisioned an independent agency independent from the legislature as well as from the governor that would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing

before i was on name staff and as staff you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss lynch said now i was appointed to an independent constitutional body while i feel ive built bridges to the governor and the legislature i take very seriously the pucs constitutional independence

critics including many in the name administration and some in the legislature call lynch unbending she is particularly adamant on the commissions independence

insisting on independence

accounts of how the name deal was reached underline lynchs insistence on preserving the pucs independent authority the events also show how strong a position she holds as the puc and the administration negotiate over the bond deal

starting in april when he unveiled his proposed rescue of name name and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the legislature name had no republican support and faced skepticism from fellow democrats

lynch was another skeptic name proposal would have weakened the pucs authority to regulate name her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of senate leader name name dsan name an ally of lynchs and the most influential critic of the governors proposal

name did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the assembly but late on sept 14 the senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any name bill

the governor said he would order lawmakers to return to sacramento in early october for a special session to consider it again

lynch seized an opportunity she wanted to escape a 55billion federal lawsuit that name had filed against the puc she also figured there might be a way to restructure names debt without the bells and whistles proposed by name and other lawmakers

it was a good time to talk wholesale electricity prices were down significantly interest rates were falling and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility

when we looked at the numbers fresh we realized that the numbers had changed enough that name might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout lynch said

at her direction puc general counsel name cohen made the initial call to name

name puc started secret talks

name executives had their doubts that the puc could resolve the utilitys problems in their view past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy

but with prospects uncertain in the legislature both sides met sept 19 in the san name offices of the utilitys private counsel munger tolles  olson talks went on for 12 days

the puc had three conditions one we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period cohen said second there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders and third there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commissions regulatory authority

lynch and the puc staff kept negotiations secret word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy they feared another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to names problem

lynch did notify her fellow commissioners whose support she would need to pull off a settlement puc commissioner name brown one of three name appointees on the fivemember board said lynch told him sept 21 in the strictest confidence about the negotiations with name

if it became public it could blow up brown said there would be too much hullabaloo

for several days however lynch did not inform name meanwhile the governors aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise

on sept 25 some of name top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session by the end of the meeting both sides realized a major gulf remained

that same day lynch called sacramento to pass word to name that the talks were underway a few lawmakers also were told two days later the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the legislature to return for a special session one reason for the delay was to see whether the puc could seal a deal

over the next several days the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the 33billion rescue plan finalizing a deal about 11 pm sept 30

it would not have gotten over the finish line without her said attorney name olson an name board member who helped represent the utility in the talks

while those negotiations were going on name was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the puc to approve the other major item on the commissions plate his proposal for the bond deal

the issue is complex but at its root lynch said the proposal pushed by name and angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the name administration struck with independent power producers

lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the pucs authority

the puc under lynch has challenged aspects of the administrations power contracts in proceedings before the federal energy regulatory commission

knowing that lynch opposed the proposal the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her he did not call lynch but did call republican commissioners name bilas and name duque

the governors lobbying changed no votes his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only brown siding with him

but his efforts appear to have enhanced lynchs standing among her fellow commissioners including the two republicans who are appointees of former gov name name

commissioners praise lynch

in bilas view the call from the governor showed that lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal even if it might cost her her job as puc president

there are only two kinds of people who can serve a yes man or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent and she is of the second type bilas said

brown the only commissioner to vote for the administrations bond proposal credits lynch as well

she stood up for the authority of the puc brown said browna cousin of name onetime boss former gov jerry brownis a potential successor to lynch as president if name decides to demote her he has not been offered the post and does not want it brown said

i hope they dont remove her as president brown said she is a feisty independent individual but she is capable of enormous good work if you appoint her you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her she is not going to be a sycophant and that is to her credit
 

craver will head up any of these specific deals that name enters into  ive known fielder for a long time very much the company guy but pretty easy to work with  ive met craver but dont know him as well as fielder  wont be a stretch to get a meeting with craver if we choose to do it  name is the counterparty  regarding the credit issue in addition to name we should also view the california puc as a cocounterparty to just about anything name does over the next 24 months or so

first thanks for the pizza  

second in line with the role play that you described in class and in the handout for the project we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon spreadsheets reams of numbers etc  given the endofsemester work load we like everyone else are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project  given the change if you would like we would be happy to beef up the presentation to include more numbers jargon and other technical gems though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well  whichever way you prefer is fine by us  just let me know

here is some additional information since the circus closed down in sacramento on saturday morning					

the senate adjourned early saturday morning closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session
the assembly adjourned a few hours later closing the regular session but not the second extraordinary session

the legislatures options 
1 the governor calls them back in two weeks they continue with the second extraordinary session and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till saturday morning
2 the governor calls them back in two weeks the assembly ends the second extraordinary session they begin a third extraordinary session and the bills that were left hanging on saturday morning must start the process from scratch  however they can pass a waiver which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session and then pick up where they left off on saturday morning
3 the governor calls them back in two weeks and the legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything ie the govenor can call them back but he cant make them vote

in short the legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please

where to from here
through its actions on saturday morning the senate has sent a strong signal to name that the senate is not inclined to vote out an name bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last july
just before closing down on saturday the senate also passed a resolution declaring that the condition of electric service in california no longer consitutes a sudden and severe energy shortage and that the state of emergency proclaimed by the governor on january 17 2001 is at and end  the resolution seems to send an additional signal that the senate does not see any great need to bail out name  the assembly did not pass the resolution however  
given the senates view and the open hositility between name and name name only remaining option seems to be to threaten the senate with vetoes unless the senate first passes the name name bill  it is unclear at this time whether name would play it that tough
with the legislature gone the action turns to the puc where a vote on da suspension is scheduled for thursday  we are working with customers and providers to stop da from being suspended or at a minimum to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive
finally name held a news conference this morning at which he said
name and senator bowen bowens been taking the lead on da in the senate will ask the california puc to do a study on how da can be retained without adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses
he doesnt know why the governor would waste taxpayers money to hold a special session
with all the troubled businesses in california right now he doesnt know why the state would bail name out and not the others

if all this sounds ridiculous it is

well report back with additional information as we get it

the senate rules committee just met  during the hearing senate leader name name stated that
the senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval sb78
the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess  that bill was unacceptable to name and name which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday night
if the senate proceeds as name suggests the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get name signature
name generally sticks to his word but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb78 could squeak by however names comments in the rules committee certainly dont help 78s chances for survival

name to repay creditors immediately but no date yet
los angeles dow jones embattled utility southern california name expects to pay all creditors immediately but the name international eix unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin said name name chairman and chief executive of name international 
we intend to pay all of our creditors name said wednesday in a call with reporters but we do not have a specific date 
southern california name and the california public utilities commission struck a deal tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off 33 billion of its 39 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates 
both parties settled a yearold lawsuit southern california name filed against the pucotherwise known as a filed rate doctrinethat could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than 5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers 
the settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge a ruling is expected by thursday 
name indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators owed nearly 1 billion to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed 
there is no deal between us and the generators at this point name said we will engage promptly in settlement discussions we are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way 
name craver names chief financial officer said the utility has between 24 and 25 billion cashonhand and about 39 billion in debt 
name said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade immediately 
weve had some discussions with the credit rating agencies name said but no one expects it to be restored immediately its going to take some time 
name added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites but he did not elaborate 
     
name name president of southern california name said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan 
name said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003 he did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off southern california names debt 
the utilitys debt rose to 635 billion according to a recent securities and exchange filing 
in the month of october we generated about 300 million from retail rates but name said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors 
the utility and the puc both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year 
name said the utility has no intention of taking over the states longterm power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the puc 
     
fearing the state legislature wouldnt support a bill to rescue southern califoria name after six months of wrangling advisers to gov gray name and name executives began negotiating with the states public utilities commission on a settlement of a yearold lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs 
the negotiations with the puc were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldnt be reached name aides and name executives said 
the end result name and the commission said is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep southern california name from following pge corp pcg unit pacific gas  electric into bankruptcy
 

hi evie
as you know name is being well name about just about everything at the puc  i think that we actually have some leverage with pge however  ive helped to broker a meeting between large customers and pge name botorff and name name this friday at 130 pm after djs meeting  dj and delainey are organizing
 
the basic idea is to see if there is some way to strike a reasonable deal on the dacost allocation issues with pge which could then be submitted to puc around name which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible
 
at the first meeting we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1 what matters to people 2 where people on the issues and 3 pges willingness to deal  the goal is to find out if theres any room for a deal  should not take a long time
 
i hope you can attend since the meeting will be significantly less productive if youre not there and who knows it may lead to something that permits us to go around name  likely attendees are cmta cleca the chamber you hopefully pge and me  name name kahl be at djs meeting

in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event the california puc today voted down name proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc
the vote was 41 with the two republicans voting with name handpicked appointees lynch and wood
name proposal was introduced at the meeting by another name appointeename brownwho made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve name proposed rate agreement

what is name proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc
it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers
it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs no questions asked

what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject name proposal
with the vote it remains unclear how californiadwr will pay for the dwr power contracts
the political pressure to renegotiateor breakthe dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably
it remains unclear how californiadwr will pay for the 125 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months
under the structure devised by name the revenues flowing from the cpucdwr rate agreement would be used to both 1 pay for the dwr power contracts and 2 service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay californias general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january
in short there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds
safe to say that todays puc vote has seriously embarrassed name and left his approach to solving california electricity crisis in shambles

what next
a broad leftright coalition of energy interests supported a bill 18xx that passed the legislature with broad bipartisan support
the bill would create a dedicated rate component on every customers bill to service the 125 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue
proponents of the billand just about everyone elseargue that the dedicated rate component is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget
the bill is silent however on how california would pay for the dwr contracts and the bills opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result
all four puc commissioners who voted against the name rate agreement today urged name to sign the bill  the leftright coalition from nader types to oil companies is also working hard to get name to sign it
name has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel
given todays vote however name may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid

update on name bailout
still appears that chances are very small that name and name will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an name bailout when it returns for another special session next tuesday

energy name and the puc clash over why only a fraction of the 20 reduction will be passed on to consumers

by miguel bustillo
times staff writer

october 20 2001

sacramento  california now expects its electricity bill to be 20 less than estimated as recently as two months ago opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale the name administration said friday 

even so the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5 the administration added 

the discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between gov gray name and public utilities commission president name lynch administration officials said residential customers wont see much relief because recent actions by the puc have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation 

specifically officials said the puc erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the states powerbuying system and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans 

lynch disagrees on both points the real problem she said again friday is that california purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis the best way to save consumers money she suggested is to renegotiate the states energy contracts 

california has been purchasing massive quantities of power since january because the states large private utilities could no longer do so and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the states economy and endanger the public the utilities pacific gas  electric san name gas  electric and southern california name ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers 

in august state officials estimated the departments power costs for 2001 and 2002 the time the state plans to be in the power business at 2145 billion the new estimate released friday pares that figure to 172 billion 

but in what consumer groups angrily called a jailbreak name administration officials disclosed for the first time friday that large businesses fled the states powerbuying system en masse this summer opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the states power costs 

big businesses bail out leave tab to consumers

the puc announced in june that it was putting a lid on the socalled directaccess deals because if the businesses left the system homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis 

however the commission did not act until last month and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system directaccess participation jumped from 2 to 13 of the overall power load being purchased by the california department of water resources according to the administrations latest numbers 

unfortunately all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers said name garris who oversees the departments powerbuying division put simply the pucs delay in suspending direct access means the states costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller retail customers 

state treasurer name angelides who requested that the puc suspend direct access earlier in the summer blasted the commission friday saying the stampede of businesses would shift as much as 8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade as they pay for the longterm contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity 

whats happened here is one of the most damaging things thats happened to consumers in this energy crisis angelides said 

and consumer groups were even more critical accusing the puc of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis 

the puc first gave name their bailout said name heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis these were the two groups the big business guys and the utilities that got us in this mess in the first place 

but lynch the puc president said the number conflicted with the commissions figures which showed direct access participation at roughly 8 of the overall load that she said was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year a little more than 7 before the energy crisis erupted it fell to a low of 2 during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses she said 

lynch accused angelides and the name administration of revisionist history saying the commission postponed its decision at the administrations request the commission then put off the decision again because the legislature was considering its own solution to the problem she said 

the real problem lynch said is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price if california had not purchased too much power consumers would not have to pay for it she said 

if people are leaving the system those are fewer people the state needs to serve lynch said the problem once again is the longterm contracts we need to renegotiate these contracts 

also adding to the states financial burden is the fallout from a 43billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time driving up the loans interest rates 

the loan was supposed to be repaid by the states planned 125billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year but the bond deal is now in limbo in part because the puc has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward as a result a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered which will soon force the department of water resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve 

name and aides stay tightlipped on strategy

in a related development the newly created state public power authority headed by s name name met friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them 

if the bond deal ever takes place the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis the state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond though advisors to the governor called that less likely 

in another action that could reduce rates name administration officials confirmed friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the longterm power contracts as the times reported thursday the contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive 

but name advisors remained tightlipped on the specifics saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks 

i dont think its real smart to tell you that said name goode the governors legal affairs secretary

no deal in energy refund talks
by name whitney
bee washington bureau
published july 10 2001
washington  negotiations to settle a tangle of issues arising out of californias electricity debacle sputtered to an end monday with the sides lightyears apart on refunds for overpriced wholesale power sales
the impasse raises the specter of years of litigation with a regulatory judge proposing a formula that could limit refunds to about 1 billion while california is seeking at least 89 billion and perhaps much more
federal energy regulatory commission administrative judge name wagner said that within a week hell urge the five ferc commissioners to begin factfinding hearings on how much is truly owed following guidelines he outlined sketchily monday
among them would be limiting the time when refunds are allowed  something that could reduce state claims by about onethird  and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a formula more favored by generators
gov gray name said he was heartened by the judges belief that california is due some amount of refund money rejecting the generators arguments for no refunds
with the 15day negotiation session nearly moribund generators and power traders had offered up 716 million in proposed refunds in the final days but wagner indicated that that would have to be offset by money the state still owes power companies meaning no cash would actually change hands
the judge held out the possibility that at least two parties including san namebased calpine corp could reach separate agreements with the state
from what i know it looks like we can reach an agreement calpine spokesman name highlander confirmed monday but he said he could not disclose any details under wagners gag order on participants in the negotiations
name corp one of the nations highestprofile power traders said california officials killed the talks by never budging from their claims that the states consumers deserved at least 89 billion in refunds for overcharges
these talks never had a chance said name spokesman name name their political skins are worth more than 716 million that the taxpayers of california could have used it was about creating and maintaining a tool for a witch hunt
of the 716 million compromise offer 510 million was put on the table by what wagner called the big five generators  reliant name mirant name and dynegy  some of whom are under state investigation another 125 million was offered by bc hydro british colombias government utility which is not under ferc jurisdiction and 165 million was offered by six california municipal utilities
the sacramento municipal utility district the states secondlargest municipal utility also declined to comment on the talks or any settlement amount it may have offered but said it would outline its position in writing thursday the judges deadline for comments on his proposal
consumer advocates and some industry officials said the judges brief public remarks make it difficult to predict exactly what the impacts could be on the states troubled electric scene
if the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion thats outrageous said name hoge head of the utility reform network if theyre going to start doing some fact finding hallelujah
hoge said the talks had been unrealistic from the start because there was no effort by ferc to determine how high the overcharges had actually been and then work toward a compromise from there
the state used a formula calculated by its nonprofit grid operator the independent system operator which was attacked by marketers as wildly high even while the state called it conservatively low
name name representing all five of the big generators said monday that the iso has consistently based its demand on sketchy and incomplete data
the faceoff between name and power merchants began last fall as wholesale electricity costs were soaring and california utilities warned that they could be driven into bankruptcy
the governor said generators and traders took advantage of the states power shortage to manipulate markets and gouge consumers generators said they followed all laws and were only deriving fair profits in a scarcity situation
ferc which entered the picture because by law it has to ensure that electricity rates are just and reasonable has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to craft a solution that could appease both sides
state assembly speaker name hertzberg dname oaks said monday that the failure of the settlement talks to agree on a refund figure comes as no surprise
negotiators representing generators refused to even acknowledge the inescapable fact that they have profited enormously by exploiting a dysfunctional market  at californias expense he said
name who had accused the generators of failing to negotiate in good faith with state representatives said that although ferc commissioners have been slow to respond to his requests for refunds and for price caps on wholesale electricity they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves
he suggested the commissioners can opt to award california more than is recommended by the judge
wagner after mediating talks that continued throughout the weekend seemed resigned to the fact that trying to bring more than 50 government utility and power generating entities together proved to be an exercise in futility
name kahn head of the california delegation and consultant to the california iso nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty well
we came here wanting 89 billion kahn said in all candor we didnt receive any meaningful settlement offers and so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped they would be but our positions were vindicated because refunds were offered
meanwhile pacific gas and electric co and southern california name sounded the call for more talks
were willing to talk to anyone anytime about a settlement said name pickett general counsel of southern california name pge said in a prepared statement that the sessions provide a solid basis for further negotiations
how much money the state might eventually receive remains the big question mark wagner said settlement offers of 716 million suggest that eventual refunds will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars maybe a billion but he also stressed that he would recommend no specific figure to ferc commissioners and does not know how big refunds might eventually be
other recommendations wagner said he would make to the commission were a mixed bag for the state
the judge said he would recommend refunds no further back than oct 2 2000 an action that kahn said would immediately slice 3 billion off the states refund analysis that stretched back to may 2000
but kahn said that was no defeat for the state which would turn to the courts to recover that and any other sums excluded from a final refund order
we still have a viable litigation claim for the remainder kahn said
name bailey vice president and general counsel of name energy of north america said he felt the formula laid out by wagner would generate a refund order in the range of 1 billion to 15 billion
its a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks bailey said

third power plant opens but the los medanos facility isnt pouring out electricity yet
by name peyton
bee staff writer
published july 10 2001
the flood of new electricity being welcomed by gov gray name was only a trickle at the latest power plant that the governor opened on monday according to sources close to californias energy crisis
heralded by name as part of a powerful onetwothree punch that will bring california closer to energy independence the los medanos energy center in pittsburg spit out no more than 20 megawatts on its opening day they said
that is less than 5 percent of the plants 555megawatt operating capacity
los medanos could generate a couple of hundred megawatts later this week but is not expected to reach its full output for two to three weeks according to knowledgable sources
representatives for calpine and the governors office when pressed for details acknowledged that the plant was not running at full tilt but said they did not know how much electricity was actually produced monday
calpine which will bill someone for whatever electricity it sells from los medanos is keeping track of the production but the figure wasnt immediately available for the media spokeswoman name potter said
even if it was two megawatts thats two more megawatts that we didnt have yesterday said name spokesman name maviglio
he said the opening was largely ceremonial timed for the convenience of the governor and calpines top executive
but consumer advocate name rosenfield called the media event a deception it was the third highly publicized power plant launch the governor has attended in the past two weeks
its the governor trying to convince people hes hard at work solving the problem when its all for show rosenfield said hes governing by sound bite hes certainly getting his moneys worth from the consultants he hired
name political adviser name south said last week that the governors new radio ad campaign will highlight the efforts to produce more power in california
generation comes up in our polls as being the no 1 thing people want us to do  build more power plants south said then people want the sense that progress is being made  that this is not spiraling out of control
the other two plants that name kicked off  sunrise in kern county and sutter near yuba city  have since been running at maximum capacity
calpine anticipates pumping the full 550 megawatts out of los medanos within a week to 10 days company officials said
in the first month of these new plants there are always stops and starts said calpine spokesman name highlander sometimes we shut down altogether
including the three justopened facilities new or expanded power plants are expected to add 1500 megawatts to the states struggling electric grid by the end of july and 870 megawatts of that is already in place according to the state independent system operator
another 1000 megawatts is anticipated for the end of august and 1100 more for the end of september under a rough timetable that is likely to see some plants zip ahead of schedule and others fall behind

state reveals highpriced power deals
by dale kasler and name bowman
bee staff writers
published july 10 2001
the state monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity on the spot market revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wildly within minutes
the department of water resources which has been criticized for keeping its powerpurchasing practices a secret released 1770 pages of invoices and trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purchases since it jumped into the energybuying business jan 17 the information was released a week after state controller name connell put out details of the states longterm power contracts over the objections of gov gray name her political nemesis
the state has committed about 81 billion to buying power on behalf of californias crippled utilities straining the budget surplus and raising questions from lawmakers and others about name policies for resolving the states energy crisis in turn state officials have accused many suppliers of gouging california to the tune of several billion dollars
when it came to the spot market the water department was at the mercy of a business run amok the state paid upward of 300 a megawatthour for days in january and february  months when electricity normally should be a lot cheaper water officials said prices have dropped to the 100 range largely because theyve signed a slew of longterm contracts reducing their dependence on spot sales
our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum said name hidalgo spokesman for the water department
the information released monday covered the first three months of the year and didnt include the highest price the water department has paid for electricity 1900 a megawatthour in may to reliant energy inc a texas generator that owns several plants in the state name energy corp of north name charged even more for power in january 3880 a megawatt hour but that sale was made to the independent system operator which runs the states transmission grid
the documents show that while the states stricken utilities no longer buy power for themselves their sister companies have sold expensive power
through may 31 the state paid a trading arm of sempra energy the parent of san name gas  electric some 429 million for power it paid pge energy trading an unregulated sister company of pacific gas and electric co about 237 million
among others the los angeles department of water and power was paid 331 million through may 31 canadian utility bc hydro was paid 105 billion atlantas mirant corp 124 billion the federal governments bonne07ville power administration 167 million and the sacramento municipal utility district 807 million
generally the more desperate the state was for power the higher the prices for instance oklahomabased generator name cos commanded 565 a megawatthour march 20 when blackouts struck more than 1 million californians
location also was critical on march 8 the state paid the pge trading unit 250 but only 180 to arizonabased pinnacle west capital corp the difference was that pges power was delivered to energystarved northern california while pinnacles was sent to southern california where energy wasnt so scarce
splitsecond timing was also crucial at 909 am feb 14 the state paid 400 to mirant for power to be delivered the next day by 10 am it was paying mieco inc a long beach trading firm 475 for the same product
thats the spot market  its the most volatile market in the world and it changes on a secondbysecond basis said name corp spokesman name name
for all the criticism leveled at name reliant and other big corporations governmentowned entities were among the most aggressive at charging high prices
bc hydro the electric utility owned by the canadian province of british columbia submitted bills for up to 1000 a megawatthour the city of glendale charged 375 a megawatthour for power in january while smud charged 309 a megawatthour in march the city of name ore averaged 450 a megawatthour in february
we play by the rules of the electricity trade marketplace said bc hydro spokesman name cousins our traders worked very hard to find additional sources of electricity to keep the lights on in california had we not come through and stepped forward with these supplies the consequences to california customers would have been severe
the state also said it has spent 144 million on administrative costs in buying power

government finds ways to conserve the santa name jail goes solar as agencies get creative to cut costs
by name miller
bee correspondent
published july 10 2001
to name muniz the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the santa name jail in dublin arent just energymakers theyre money in the bank
when all 4000 panels are completely installed this month the 500kilowatt photovoltaic system  the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the united states  will cut the jails demand on the electric grid by up to 20 percent according to muniz alameda countys energy program manager
that sun power combined with conservation projects already completed at the jail will slash about 300000 a year from the facilitys energy bill muniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential
with the cost of electricity going up you can start looking at it as a business decision just investing your money said muniz theres virtually no maintenance on this equipment it just sits on your roof and converts right into electricity that youre using as soon as you generate it i think solar is the wave of the future even though its been around 30 or 40 years
the santa name jail project is among the largest and perhaps most conspicuous examples of steps government agencies are taking to cut electricity use in response to skyrocketing power bills and gov gray name call for public entities to conserve
among the examples
san name leaders are pondering a bond measure to finance solarpowered rooftop projects around the city
the tulare county town of lindsay will open city hall two hours earlier  at 6 am and close at 430 pm monday through thursday this summer so offices can stay dark all day friday and during peakuse afternoon hours
sacramento county has instituted a casual dress policy so employees can better withstand office temperatures that climb as high as 78 degrees workers have also set sprinklers to run at night so that electric water pumps operate during low demand
when you start to see the bills going up and you start to hear concerns from some citizens that obviously raises the threshold of wanting to help out said jolena voorhis an energy analyst at the california state association of counties certainly counties stepped up to the plate when they were asked to increase conservation efforts theyve done about as much as humanly possible
kings county leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signed up for southern california names interruptible load program which promises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrical services in times of shortage
then californias power crisis hit fullforce this year since january name has called on the central valley county to cut electricity at its hanford government center 16 times  for up to six hours each cycle
at times that meant no lights to greet the public no computers to process food stamp requests and during the valleys foggy winter days no heat to warm many of the 1200 employees
we had one week in january when we were virtually shut down said chief administrative officer name spikes we just decided we couldnt function that way
so kings county supervisors bought a 550000 dieselpowered generator to match those already at the jail and juvenile center they also decided to open and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so buildings can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 pm
the new hours dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the generators kick on have become a routine part of doing government business these days spikes said
so far most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without cutting into programs because of relatively healthy budgets in recent years voorhis said
public agencies power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses
revenues at powerlight the berkeley company that installed the santa name jail photovoltaic system have tripled since last year
the last six months have been particularly intense said name lin director of business development for powerlight in some ways the energy crisis in california has been a call to action
the sacramento municipal utility district which already boasts the largest photovoltaic program in the country has a 2000customer waiting list for solar projects and plans to bring sun power to the state capitol said name osborn smuds solar program manager
back in dublin the 3600 inmates at the santa name jail still receive three meals air conditioning and hot showers  powered now in part by the plentiful sun in this relatively fogfree part of the east bay
the 4 million project financed entirely with state and utility subsidies should generate enough savings to pay for itself within the decade muniz said
its a good investment for the money were putting up front he said






   energy talks reach no settlement state threatens suit        by name name associated press  july 10 2001  washington  with talks between the state and power generators stalled california may go to court to help win the 89 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity  i think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the ferc and to the judge that the state is owed 89 billion and will settle for nothing less said name salazar a spokesman for gov gray name  with negotiations at an impasse the administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said california is probably owed no more than 1 billion in refunds    the numbers were too far apart said name wagner the ferc chief administrative law judge  california wagner said may receive nothing at all because generators may be owed more than they have to return for any overcharges  he placed the refunds owed the state at between 716 million and 1 billion power providers had offered 716 million as part of an overall settlement while california state officials sought 89 billion wagner said  he said california officials had not made the case for 89 billion in refunds  salazar however said the state would go to court and may ask for 20 billion  separately wagner split off claims of overcharges from the pacific northwest saying he has not had time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by ferc last month  wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a settlement to ferc by next monday the commission ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown of californias deregulated electricity market  consumer advocates assailed the judges recommendation and urged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power companies  its like catching a bank robber but instead of making him give back all of it you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole said name heller spokesman for the santa namebased foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights  power generators however were generally pleased with wagners comments  name bailey general counsel for name energy said even if the formula wagner recommends produces 15 billion in refunds thats a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks  california officials negotiating on behalf of utilities the public utilities commission and state power buyers accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices  the producers have acknowledged prices are high but blame jumps in the price of natural gas which fuels many power plants and the workings of the free market  the bill for wholesale power in california soared to 27 billion last year from 7 billion the year before name has estimated the state could spend as much as 50 billion this year  the producers reiterated monday that californias numbers are grossly inflated attorneys for the five major generators  name energy dynegy mirant reliant energy and the name cos  said in a statement that they have made a very substantial global settlement offer  reliant would agree to no more than 50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims said name h stout a company senior vice president  but stout also said reliants fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are justified              refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        judge sees possibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state by toby eckert  copley news service  july 10 2001  washington  settlement talks between california and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collapsed yesterday and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal regulators set a course far from favorable to the states demand for 89 billion in refunds  there are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars name l wagner jr chief administrative law judge for the federal energy regulatory commission said in previewing the recommendations he will make to the commission  but wagner who mediated the talks also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums for electricity that probably are higher than any overcharges for which they may have to pay refunds  that opened the possibility that california could see no cash refunds only a reduction in the billions of dollars the power generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and utilities  wagner said he would recommend that ferc hold a fasttrack hearing to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from californias power crisis  wagner also outlined a method that he said ferc should use for calculating refunds  while his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used it contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers who maintain that californias numbers are wildly exaggerated  i would suspect that would result in a number much below 89 billion said joe ronan vice president of calpine a san namebased electricity generator i think wagners method reflects more accurately what actually happened in the states dysfunctional power market  but name kahn the states lead negotiator said wagner vindicated californias core arguments  the hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there should not be any refunds and that position was loudly rejected said kahn chairman of the organization that manages most of californias power grid  we think the numbers even using the judges formula are going to be in the multiple billions whatever amount of money    is awarded to us we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder so what we have here is a situation where california will get its 89 billion  power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome to them they sought an end to investigations of their conduct and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position  during two weeks of negotiations ordered by ferc the two sides came nowhere near bridging their differences wagner said a number of power sellers had put forward offers that totaled 7161 million  thats a long way from splitting the difference he said in 15 days you cant work miracles  yesterday  the deadline for completing the talks  the ill will between the two sides broke into the open as wagner allowed reporters into the previously closed hearings  each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals  name h stout a senior vice president at reliant energy wholesale group said the state used biased calculations to arrive at its 89 billion refund demand he also said that reliant offered to knock 50 million off the 300 million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state  kahn shot back that reliant made the offer confidentially to wagner and never approached the state  figures scrutinized this is the first time weve heard any of this information and to give the impression that somehow theres been cooperation or forthcomingness i think is misleading kahn said  the states refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks  the 89 billion figure emerged from a study by the california power grid operator of charges for electricity between may 2000 and may 2001 a period when wholesale power prices soared  kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have been if a pricing method instituted by ferc last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period  ferc ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the west  in a partial win for the state wagner said he would recommend that ferc use the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds an approach resisted by the power sellers  but he said that ferc should only scrutinize charges going back to october 2000 and should make several key changes in how powergenerating costs are calculated  for instance he said ferc should determine the actual amount of gas heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in northern and southern california to determine the cost of gas rather than a statewide average cost computed monthly  fewer overcharges those and other parts of the complex formula wagner will recommend could increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of overcharges  kahn said that applying fercs pricing method only back to october would put about 3 billion of the states refund claim offlimits  name bailey vice president and general counsel for name energy north america said we think wagners modifications are certainly a vast improvement over fercs june 19 order and also certainly over the states model  america  in sacramento gov gray name issued a statement characterizing the electricity suppliers as

name walters as californias malaise deepens gray name standing plummets 



published oct 7 2001 

a year ago gray name was riding high  because californians were prosperous confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo 

name high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance or any personal affection among californians for their cool and distant governor he was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings 

today a dark cloud has descended on the state a sharp decline in the economy particularly hightech sectors a stubborn energy crisis and most recently the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of californiabound airliners have left californians worried about their personal safety and economic security and theyre looking for someone to blame 

name approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation and they have continued to sag thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for reelection in 13 months 

the seriousness of name decline was underscored late last month in a statewide field poll indicating that at the moment most california voters would prefer former los angeles mayor name riordan to name history indicates that name should still be favored to win a second term but if riordan does become the republican candidate he would have at least an outside chance of unseating name 

name chief problem is that he will be running for reelection in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings state tax revenues are in a nosedive running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year and name will be compelled to make multibilliondollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups 

how big the state budget hole will become is anyones guess theres a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project some analysts believe that name problem could rival the 14 billion deficit that predecessor name name confronted in 1991 name swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in american history 

however large the states fiscal problem may be it will be much much larger if the state money name spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue and the 125 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the public utilities commission consumer groups and pacific gas and electric are opposing the administrations demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review 

its apparent now that the longterm contracts the administration signed are much too expensive which is why name own appointees to the puc are balking name could try to renegotiate the contracts but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place or he could accept the legislatures proposal contained in legislation on his desk that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities purchases must receive but name is insisting that hell veto the measure 

the effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts as well as name monthslong effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped southern california name and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game will undermine the governors claim for a second term he comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted and signed tooexpensive contracts even as the power market was contracting that and californians increasing apprehension about their future will make his reelection a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned

word on da is not good  thus far it appears that the puc study outlined in the letter from name  co to lynch is as far as the senate wants to go at this time but folks continue to push  seems to be a possibility that if the legislature does reconvene there may be a push by green senators to pass a green only da bill

in addition lynch is setting the stage to have the puc reject the rate agreement between dwr and the puc on tuesday  this despite the governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners  despite the strong arm tactics it appears that brown may be the only aye vote at this point

name devises new borrowing plan 
his executive order could speed up 125 billion in bond sales and bypass puc oversight of repayment mechanism 
sacramento  gov gray name is crafting a new plan to expedite the longdelayed borrowing of 125 billion to repay the sagging california state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis 
the plan  which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week  would minimize the role of the states top power regulator the public utilities commission which enraged name last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan 
with enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two states largest utilities the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis 
that is one scenario name spokeswoman name mclean said wednesday when asked about the proposal there are a number of different scenarios being considered nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced 
most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell 125 billion in revenue bonds most of which about 96 billion would go back into the state treasury the issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid  a critical step before they could be marketed to investors 
name wanted the puc to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the states energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers but the puc said the administrations proposal might prove inadequate over time leading to future rate hikes 
the puc also said the administrations plan gave too much authority to the namecontrolled department of water resources by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue 
the puc which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates did not want to cede that authority it rejected the name plan oct 2 on a 41 vote led by its president name appointee name lynch 
name earlier said the commissions approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market 
the plan now under review however would bypass that 
the dwr would not directly set rates but under the name plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated  in effect guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy wall street 
the administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes 
lynch said wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations but questioned whether name had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the dwr to get involved in setting rates 
ive been told for six months that the puc was needed to pass a rate agreement if the dwr can get the bonds sold by themselves then great lynch said but to dedicate rates it takes a financing order from the puc or a statutory change in law a statutory setaside it takes one of those two things 
the governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the legislatures version of the payback plan by law the governor has until sunday to act on sb18xx by senate leader name name dsan name 
name opposes names bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid followed by the energy suppliers the power companies contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority which name believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute 
if name signs the order soon the bonds could go to market early next year having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected 4 billion to 6 billion shortfall in other income
 

good idea  thanks  yes im around
 

got names number  im going to call him today  any specific info youd like to have or just generally what he and dwr are up to on the gas side  i also assume that wed like to meet with him to discuss possible opportunities

sacramento  the state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power  suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result 

officials of the department of water resources said the state will need 17 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002  about 20 percent less than previously estimated 

the agency began buying power on jan 17 when the states three investor owned utilities were no longer considered creditworthy at the time prices on the spot market reached upwards of 450 a megawatt hour now however prices average 30 a megawatt hour 

circumstances have changed said name nichols of navigant consulting which is a consultant to the department of water resources conservation has helped we think the dwr contracts have established reliability in the market we have broken the back of the spot market 

earlier this year the state signed 56 longterm contracts with various generators to purchase power those contracts which were inked when prices were at their peak have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the puc 

and gov gray name administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts 

but the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day the rest comes from the spot market  purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed prices on the spot market have dropped in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive 

it is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs if the projections hold the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue 125 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases 

at the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs they blasted the state public utilities commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers 8 billion 

administration officials and state treasurer name angelides said a puc decision to delay the suspension of direct access  the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power  will shift higher costs to smaller customers 

the puc proposed the ban on direct access in june but didnt adopt the policy until sept 20 during that period the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent 

whats happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis angelides said yesterday 

he urged the puc to reverse its decision setting the date back to july 1 

but lorretta lynch president of the puc said the delay was at the request of the administration and the legislature 

she also objected to angelides numbers saying that the puc estimates the direct access load at 8 percent the commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to july 1 and action will be taken at the next puc meeting she said

fyi  note below that even the mighty and powerful power authoritys own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short despite dwr contracts and da stampede which should leave one to believe that contrary to angelides letter the more the da the better which further supports name lynchs response to the angelides letter that da reduces the amount of spot power dwr has to buy

consumer power and conservation financing authority 
pace of power authority renewable portfolio agenda is slowed 
quite possibly the most significant action taken at the october 19 consumer power and conservation financing authority power authority was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval the power authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible 
instead of approving a number of contracts on its october 19 agenda the power authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its november 2 meeting acknowledging that no action can be taken until the department of water resources dwr rate agreement stalemate has been resolved 
chairman name stated that the public utility commissions rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the power authority to exercise renewable contracts to contract for peaker generation andor to implement demand side programs the power authority relies upon dwrs credit to fund these programs and until a rate agreement is finalized the power authority cannot sign contracts 
name indicated that the power authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the central valley as well as 400 mw generated by wind 
with the current glut of contracts why do we need additional reserves 
kellan flukinger senior advisor to chairman name and name doll provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the power authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in longterm contracts there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the state 
flukinger concluded that the state still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to puc regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the state he believes that the shortterm contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to pricespikes and supply shortages he believes that the reserve can be managed through timeofuse and realtimepricing conservation interruptibles demand side management renewables and peakers

name name was approved as chief financial officer of the power authority at its october 19 board meeting in sacramento mr name currently works for the city of san name and has worked in the past for the new york power authority

ferc to examine alleged market manipulation by calif iso
updated friday september 21 2001 0453 pm et by name leopold of dow jones newswires
los angeles dow jonesfederal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of californias wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its powerpurchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under longterm contracts according to documents obtained friday by dow jones newswires friday
at issue is whether the california independent system operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market the states need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for gov gray name who signed 43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized
the federal energy regulatory commission will hold a meeting in california monday to address generators complaints the energy companies say that the california isos purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market according to a letter sent by name wolfman lead ferc counsel for market oversight and enforcement
the letter was sent to the iso the california department of water resources  which has been buying power in lieu of the states struggling utilities since midjanuary  and several generators all of which were to attend the meeting
recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the california iso as they have had to change in the last nine months are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure wolfman said in her letter the purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the iso and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch generators utilities cdwr on appropriate practices and procedures
iso procedures need explaining ferc
the isos main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the states electrical grid as part of that job the iso determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from
if the iso cant explain how it makes its decisions ferc may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market wolfmans office said
as discussed ferc may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of caiso a second letter from fercs market oversight and enforcement division states this unprecedented examination of caiso operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the iso should be investigated
the isos operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first
the information that generators have provided all leads to a theory that the caiso is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus dwr power at high prices and protect gov name from political embarrassment the second letter says
the iso has said only that the market isnt operating as intended and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss mondays meeting
generators confused
generators including mirant corp mir httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3dmir news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3dmir msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3dmir reliant energy inc rei httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3drei news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3drei msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3drei name cos wmb httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3dwmb news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3dwmb msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3dwmb name energy duk httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3dduk news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3dduk msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3dduk and dynegy inc dyn httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsquotessymbol3ddyn news httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsnewssymbol3ddyn msgs httpquickenexcitecominvestmentsdiscusssymbol3ddyn have bought apparently inexpensive power in the isos spot market only to find weeks later that the price was much higher thats because according to the allegations the iso is letting dwr supply expensive power into the market as outofmarket purchases that arent averaged into the realtime prices that iso market participants see
dwr continues to buy outofmarket power regularly at the isos request dwr operations chief name garris has said but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from dwrs longterm contracts
the outofmarket purchases appear to be expensive however according to the isos august market report the average outofmarket price for peak hours was 5590 a megawatthour compared with 2649mwh on the iso computerized market brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the outofmarket prices for months
none of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record
the meeting is scheduled to be held at the isos headquarters in folsom calif and representatives from power producers utilities and the state are expected to attend ferc will serve as facilitator wolfman said the meeting isnt open to the public
the meeting will begin with a presentation by the iso on its practices and operational procedures followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market
the objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices wolfman said in the letter

nevada puc acts to change or void longterm pwr contracts 
los angeles dow jones the nevada public utilities commission wednesday voted to allow its general counsel office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate longterm electricity contracts entered into by the states two largest utilities a puc spokeswoman said 
the contracts would force name pacific resources srp utilities name pacific power co and nevada power co to pay a higher price for power than current market rates said name soderberg puc chairman 
we paid high prices when the prices were high but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous soderberg said 
no one at name pacific or nevada power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities or the value of the contracts 
the puc action follows a letter sent by gov name guinn to the federal energy regulatory commission in early october asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts 
the general counsels office will now have authority to file with ferc and in court to plead against the current contracts 
name pacific has said that a june ferc order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company name pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices the company has said as well if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market it will now receive less for that power under the cap it has said 
california s public utilities commission is also pushing for renegotiation of 43 billion in longterm contracts signed by the state which has been buying power on behalf of cashstrapped utilities since january
 

please forward along to others i may have missed but need to know

the commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the da suspension
with minor exceptions the utilities told the commission that the commission didnt need to conduct hearings and that the commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees  
the utilities said that hearings could be held sometime later to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the px credit going forward
a large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings
there were lengthy arguments in front of the judge at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference
the next hearing will be on dec 12th
the judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last friday
in sum there will be another hearing on dec 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the commission making decisions on these issues
at this point it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings
of particular note at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is not inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of direct access to july 1 and that he didnt think that the puc commissioner assigned to the case was either worried that he said too much he then said he couldntshouldnt spead for the commissioner
the judge and the commissioner who was at the hearing went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their da contracts to the puc as requested in the document the puc issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues
our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1 the commission didnt need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2 the commission doesnt have the authority to ask to see contracts and they aint likely going to get them without a fight  
though the probability many not be high there is at least the chance that the commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts  seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity
interestingly name made a run at getting the commission to implement by january 1 its proposal to charge all customersda and bundled alikefor names undercollection  
the judge literally laughed off the request and then said no  
as a result name didnt get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the negative ctc issue
the judge also gave the dwr representative a pretty good thrashing eg why are you here you refuse to be a party you refuse to provide info etc
from todays hearing it appears that dwr will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized  
in related news name has announced that hes asked sempra to meet to renegotiate their dwr contract and said that hed thus far met with two other generators in serious negotitations

here are the foundations that arm will use in its appeal of the puc decision suspending da and threats to make it retroactive to july 1  you should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential  and of course wed be thrilled if theyd sign on  if you have any questions just holler
best
name

the primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows 
the decision violates procedural due process guarantees 
the failure to hold hearings violates public utilities code section 17085f 
the commissions reliance on material outside the record violates due process 
the decision violates the commerce clause of the united states constitution 
the threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the commissions authority 
the commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority 
the decisions purported findings are not supported 
the commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasilegislative proceeding

pge utility reorganization draws fire in calif 
san francisco oct 10 reuters  pge corps plan to reorganize its bankrupt pacific gas  electric unit californias biggest utility is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation 
critics said that with california beginning to emerge from a twoyear energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the states utilities in red ink now is no time to abandon state oversight 
name lynch president of the california public utilities commission cpuc called the plan a regulatory jailbreak and a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation by transferring assets to unregulated pge affiliates 
the reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into standalone companies transferring the hydro network diablo canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent pge 
the utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers 
the plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout said name name chairman president and chief executive of pge 
it would provide creditors with about 91 billion in cash and 41 billion in notes 
eye on hydro system 
one of the concerns arising from the plan is how pacific gas  electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties which make up the worlds largest privately held hydropower system 
elected officials from 28 counties in pges sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern california will meet friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the san name federal bankruptcy court sept 20 
the regional council of rural counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro systems rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about twothirds of the state council vice president name lujan told reuters 
pge spokesman name name said the hydro system nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission or the nuclear regulatory commission 
the utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour 
but state attorney general name lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the cpuc and avoid state laws on the asset transfers 
lockyer said that in the past pge had used cpuc oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny 
despite pges claim that the cpuc has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent cpuc chief counsel name cohen said the agencys approval is required under state law 
fire sale prices 
pges goal is clear they want to transfer most of the utilitys valuable assets to an affiliate company at fire sale prices so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation it is a deregulation plan not a reorganization plan cohen said 
pges plan conflicts with californias interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system deregulation has failed the public and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation said name heller of consumer advocate the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights 
pges name said the plan makes the most sense for california because units of pge would continue to own and manage power production and transmission 
name said however the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company 
pges plan would give the utility 45 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about 13 billion in debts including 9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs 
the cpucs cohen and consumer groups said pge should receive far more than 45 billion from the assets 
they point to the value of the hydro network last fall the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for 28 billion because the system was undervalued in todays market and could fetch a much higher price through an auction 
the pge utility and name internationals southern california name utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers 
socal name and the cpuc reached a deal oct 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors

im sure that by now everyones seen the letter that angelides sent to name last friday  if you havent let me know and ill have it faxed to you  in short angelides blames all of the financial woes of the state on name and the puc  specifically he claims that by allowing da signups to extend to september 20th the puc may have shifted over 8 billion to homeowners small businesses and other enterprises  angelides ends the lettery by urging the commission to immediately roll back the da suspension date to july 1

the concern of course is that angelides assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention ie direct access8 billion tax on homeowners  

to her credit name refuted angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the dwr contracts  she also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the july 1september 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting

in light of these events and the increasing attacks on name by angelides and others in the administration it might be useful to give name an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating

angelides is all wetda and fairness are not mutually exclusive and the puc has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward  thus the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis
restating that the puc has no legal authority to retroactively suspend da to july 1 etc etc

folks may have other points to make  seems that wed want to keep the letter short and to the point however  

a letter might be useful in order to 1 give name some support and 2 get some counterpress in response to the angelides tantrum

any thoughts

commissioners name m duque and name a bilas dissenting

one could say that this order is consistent with the administrations present third world country mentality we are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market

we are not convinced that the department of water resources dwr bond ratings depend on killing direct access  this notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds direct access should be seen as a benefit to dwr  it would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve dwr from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner 

something else is going on here we think that the dwr does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives it will make dwrs purchasing mistakes abundantly clear the commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by dwr finance and the treasurer  instead the commission is making an ill informed panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later 

	dwr and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if dwr is making prudent energy purchases only if dwrs contracts are too expensive relative to market will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices indeed retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on dwr to make more prudent purchases this is a very important consideration since ab 1x prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the dwr costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds if there is no yardstick how can anyone measure dwr performance the answer is one cant unless sb 18xx is signed into law  

	we think that additional review of these issues before suspending direct access would have produced a more sound decision in the long run 

for these reasons we must respectfully dissent

usa update 1pge utility gives calpine debt priority status

07062001
reuters english news service
c reuters limited 2001

changes 1st paragraph adds details company statement 
san jose calif july 6 reuters  independent power generator calpine corp said on friday that its contracts with pacific gas and electric co will be altered ensuring that calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt california utility and that it will get paid more than 250 million for power already sold
calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent or more than 5 to 43 after the announcement 
as part of the contract modification the 267 million with interest that the utility a unit of pge corp  owes calpine in past due receivables under the contracts will be elevated to administrative priority status a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors 
calpine will get the money in a lump sum as soon as pge has a confirmed reorganization plan which can take as long as four to six months from now calpine said 
the move is also a step in the process of untangling californias energy crisis which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts 
under the agreement calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 537 cents per kilowatthour 
the contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because calpines power plants are qualifying facilities these types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the states power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities 
calpine is the first power company to modify its qf contract with pge to ensure that northern california consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources calpine senior vice president name macias said in a statement

heres our assessment of wrights performance in california

on the plus side
he is generally probusiness and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth eg he opposed the windfall profits and related bills
he sided with the california assembly republicans to craft an alternative to the mou for name that included direct access as a core feature of any mou
his decision to work with the republicans helped move the political center of gravityalbeit marginallymore favorably toward direct access in california

on the negative side 
in each and every case that name has had to make a choice between the market customers and competition on the one hand and the utility on the other he has never waivered in his decisionhe always put the utility first
here are three examples and there are more  
1 	during this extraordinary session he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a stranded cost charge for utilities 	yet by most accounts californians have already paid off the utilties stranded costs  how many times must californians pay 	we worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill
2	in the alternative mou that name worked on with republicans the replicans told us that name insisted on suspending direct 	access until january 1 2003a demand that most believe originated with name
3	name sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services  today this issue is less important to us but it was very important to us at the time and name remained 	unswervingly in the utilities camp despite our efforts

the administration does not project that the state will need to make additional state loans to support the dwr power supply program even if dwr does not issue its revenue bonds as planned during the 200102 fiscal year dwr projects that its funds on hand at the date of this official statement and projected revenues appear to be sufficient to finance the power supply program the cash needs of the power supply program depend among other things on future power purchase costs the timing and amount of revenues from power sales the availability of additional interim loans and the timing of the issuance of revenue bonds by dwr the power supply act limits loans and advances from the state under the power supply act after november 15 2001 to amounts required for shortterm cash flow purposes of no more than 500 million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days however the governor has the power under the emergency services act to order additional loans or other advances to dwr if needed to further mitigate the emergency

	the state expects to maintain adequate cash reserves to fund its normal operations during the 200102 fiscal year whether or not dwr repays the state loans during the fiscal year the state plans to issue shortterm notes to assure that adequate cash balances are maintained the state has regularly issued shortterm debt in the past to meet its cash flow needs see state indebtednesscash flow borrowings

if we have not located any dealmaker interested in this counterparty can we close out this counterparty and get it out of the work cue
 

branches  only relates to those branches of a multibranch party which under isda can only be a bank

restrictions  things put in the restrictions column should be those things so critical to trading paymentsettlement or contract formation that you should not enter into a trade unless you read it  it is not a place to dump general legal negotiation stuff  examples would be  masters limited to natural gas or crude oil trading only no payment netting between energy commodity and interest rate and currency transactions no oral trades allowed only the treasurer can enter to trades for the company all agreements for this counterparty require two signatures  you can do a sort on the pending swap update  executed which will then show you all the restrictions then scroll down and look at the type of restrictions entered into for the different companies to get a flavor for these types of restrictions  but we dont want to junk it up with general legal negotiation stuff  just critical dont trade unless you look at this stuff

name my marketer out of the portland office had word that a ees marketer  name dickinson  was looking to contact a utility in the northwest the reason that ees was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and ees would help them create or structure 

this marketing effort is at the core of what ena  wholesale gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help 

regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts utility business is a ena customer and i consider them a primary wholesale customer

i have not discussed this is anyone at ees but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with ees on our behalf

pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me

name from what i am hearing we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around  prior to the move in  i still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week 

once things settle down  assuming they do i look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts  it is my observation that we have not made the progress i would have liked in terms of information flow and although there has been progress there is a ways to go this probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else

looking forward to those discussions

assuming that our bids stay in the range discussed previously what are we going to do

current economics approx 400000 bid on the table plus ena holds option apr 02  oct 02 to put capacity to buyer  under this structre suncor keeps capacity until apr 02 there are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be

good morning there is no issue on your email that is going to get in the way of family issues so dont worry about that namet knee cap the band because you guys owe me  400000  i was just checking on what your decision was keep me posted 
 
name
 

name why does puget have credit concerns with us  it was my understanding that we had a mtm of 50 mm in which they were out of the moneyi thought the risk was realtively short term  winter gas  you would think that they would be fine with loading up on name irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a ldc doesnt like our credit 

with regards to a meeting i have yet to make my way up that way and would still like to make that tour which includes puget northwest natural cascade etc 

i think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal  i will call you today 

name
 

call me in a few minutes to discuss bp discussions
 

as you guys know the 2003 pgt expansion plans are supposed to be 230000day the landscape of the shippers list is ever changing rumors of ppl pulling out 85000day to malin and stanfield is unconfirmed  we are trying to validate and potentially avista pulling out as they have been downgraded they hold 35000day in 2003 combined this is almost half of the planned expansion 

although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately i believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together as you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211000  day is made up 2 shippers calpine 35000day and newport gen 175000day and this expansion has its own issues  

as we know more about shippers moving around i will pass on pls do same

name
 

what date is this planned for bt
 

i tried to call you last night around 600  i was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell  really nothing too pressing but schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans i did talk to him and told him not to assume that our pgt capacity will go to newco because newco does not really exist and may never so i told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use if it isnt then we dont really need to talk it they determine it is still ours then we need to think about what the estate should do with it including the upstream parts  
 
call me this am 
 
name
 

i would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount 10000  25000 instead of up to 200000 as i am sure there is no way they will get that high

name i presented a form of assignment to pge as recently as 2 weeks ago including other structures generally speaking they hate the el paso pipe because of its flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that el paso deliverability becomes more reliable 

having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view  assuming you can agree on values but i think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get regardless it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further have name or name call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset

further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the jm huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of the 30000day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with huber is effectively completed in the event that this deal does not close then the west desk will resume with the same mtm risks that you presently have  

any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk plus ena orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals 

in addition to the transportation income being generated additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks i believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book  by name whitt  and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly

i trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and i am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone

for the most part the term of the back to back was 23 yearswith step up volumes

name
 

lorelie attached is a price distribution table that is set up as a template for sppc power load as it relates to market prices  and load  as you can see this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down  the distribution  fixed price vs floating  may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today  relative to the historical numbers but those iterations can be made as required

pls review and we can discuss at your convenience

also as discussed i am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult  with that being said however i do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ena and sppc are both protected and i would like to pursue this with you one area that i would like to start with to have sppc sell ena physical gas  3000040000day against a physical gas daily related price  once i have accumulated a payables position we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contractspaper currently in place  i am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest

name trust all is well 

i just wanted to update you on a couple of things and recheck smuds interest

1 the on again off again pgt assignment of 10000 mmbtu per day out of nov 2002 appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested i will forward to you latest offer once we have firmed it up with the third party 

2 it is my understanding that you own el paso  pge topock capacity until may 31 2003  ena has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period june 1 2003  may 30 2006  with the renewal rights plus some sort of  payment  from ena to smud  rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006 

pls advise if either of these points capture your interest 

thanks in advance 

name tycholiz
 

name it appears that we pay a monthly fee of  8999  mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges  i would like to discuss the details of a bill what is this base fee are there other plans available are we getting any value in using cingular  especially this plan how many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates 

in aggregate my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around 1400   2000mth for 7 people total and this is a little high 

also pls verify who has cell phones in name and what the monthly bills look like for this office

thanks bt
 

as we had talked about yesterday any deals cut by el paso are going to be opposed by the shippers  when it comes to adding new capacity or expanding  until the existing issues are resolved

hey name  i am going to send you an email that attaches a referral form to your job postings  in addition i will also personally tell the hiring manager that i have done this and i can also give him an extra copy of youe resume  hopefully we can get something going here
 

i guess we know why it tanked now  i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions  at this point  i would believe anything  this sucks  we have an employee meeting tomorrow  everyone is waiting to here what lay has to say
 

i would like to bid 5 points on jay fiedler
 

should we be invested in oil producers instead of enron and calpine
 

im at a loss on calpine also  seems like they should be a fairly high debt company with all these power plants they are building  seems like they could refinance debt at these low interest rates and improve their bottom line  i dont know  just a thought  the rest of the ideas you had sound fine to me
 

i guess i need access to view the site with the pl that is if i am supposed to have it
 

i heard a rumor that you guys may be hiring  is this true and if so  for what
 

we have a meeting at 3 today  cnbc is doing a report at 350  i will let you know
 

hi name  i was trying to complete the form to nominate the kids center for this award and i need the phone number and fax number there  im not sure why i dont have them but i dont  thanks for your help
 

hi name  wanted to make a couple more changes on the resume after having someone review it  will forward this evening  thanks again
 

i also would bid 5 points for charlie batch if i dont get fiedler  i also want to bid 25 points for jason brookins
 

i will be attending the party
 

they halted trading on the stock  we are restating all financial statement since 1997  i couldnt sell in time  i hope you  talked to rick  i couldnt get ahold of you  this sucks really bad
 

i would like to bid 10 points for wade richey in this weeks free agency draft
 

this is so ironic
 

hows this for the daily update    today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued  recent news reports including the wall street journal article today have speculated about possible mergers takeovers and equity investors as options that name is considering  the reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation  however i will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company  i will keep you updated on developments as they occur 
 
 
hmmmmmmmmmm

get in touch with both of them
 

hey  seems like we arent the only ones that think kyle is an arrogant asshole anymore  susan told me that on saturday night she had it out with him and doesnt want him around  also apparently hes been treating dana like shit and its starting to get noticed by other people  just thought this was an interesting development
 

let me talk to wes and find out really where this stuff is   it may be closer to ngpl perm  i have no idea until i see the physical location
 

hey name  just checking in with you  it was good to see yall again but wed love to come out to the house sometime in october  i wanted to see what your sundays looked like  we are out on the 1921 but thats all  also do you have contact info for name and name  id love to get in touch with both of them

can you give me the address for the kids center so i can complete the nomination form  also do we put knowledge beginnings or lorraine as the center director
 

wow  i wonder
 

see  great minds think alike  also  check this out  from corporate security
late on october 25th we received information about a nonspecific threat to the name center  we communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit  nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the name center still further
 

the 14th is much better for me as we already have plans on the 7th
 

have fun in port a  ill tentatively pencil in the 28th  let me know if something comes up and i will do the same

okay heres what youre supposed to do and try not to be lame and
   spoil the fun just give in copy not forward this entire email and paste
   it onto a new email that you will send change all of the answers so that
   they apply to you then send this to a bunch of people you know
   including the person who sent it to you the theory is that you will learn a lot of    little known facts about your friends it is fun and easy

   remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you

celestine  i have not been a member now for over a year  can you take me off your mailing list  thanks
 

tell me what you think  or any ideas to add  the changes were done by pat  i havent read it yet as it would be odd to pull it up here so i dont know if i agree with them or not
 

thank my buddy rachel for all these things
 

i think its going to be virtually impossible for me to skip out early on afternoon meetings for a while  so i may end up having to be here til 5 on days that we have the bigger  ones  this sucks but i think i just have to out up with it for a while  you okay with this
 

great pictures  too bad you have to go back to real life  anything new on the job search
 

hey martin  i sent you an adddrop request  i am bidding zero points obviously
 

i talked to chris a little bit and he is going to call back tonight at 6 at home
 

i did that the first time  it takes me to a page that says i do not have permission to view that sight  and it directs me to send you an email
 

well  the gentlemans package seems a little excessive since it has a manicure and a haircut thrown in  it looks like if we do the massage and facial only  it would be about 150 total  the phone number is 7136856718
 

david  where are we on this  is there any hope of getting this done
 

why dont i try kim or marta first
 

i need trade access to the western canada gas products on eol  thanks
 

i dont know him but hes legit  just looked him up  what job are they calling about
 

sounds like you have some good prospects  if you can land something decent in this economy then i think youre doin okay  good luck  keep me updated
 

ok  let me know when you guys can try to come up with a solution  also mike would like to know if eol can work on a new functionality that would allow a trader to create a fixed price physical product that could link to price basis and index in order to prevent arb opportunities from the market  any ideas on that
 

i also talked to the manager of the east region scheduling group and he said he would have hr call you for a screening interview so be ready  call me anytime after about 11
 

the seats are in the lowest section  within one of the baselines i cant really remember what row  they are pretty good though
 

susanmscotthotmailcom
 

so  heres the synopsis  everything is business as usual  we have alot of cash and almost all of our counterparties are supporting us 100  we are about to get more credit lines within a few hours  its going to be rough but everything being done right now is to protect the gas and power trading businesses and we will be the best compensated people in the company
 

i probably cant find a baby sitter that late on a thursday


no  i got her number though  i want to hook up with that girl paige in the brown leather jacket  what happened to you  i had a blast that night
 

i wont be a waiter for more than a year  it takes time  it isnt like i will change my profession to a waiter  it will just be something to pay the bills  i dont know why it is so hard for you to understand that  i havent heard about my house
 

i felt fine  i was just tired but i didnt feel bad  my golf game sucks but that is bc i have a new golf swing after my lesson a couple of weeks ago  this swing is going to take me  to the next level  i think if trading doesnt work out i will have something to fall back on
 

rr was fun  we went downtown first and it sucked  i felt like i was in kabul w all of al queda  rr was packed though  i didnt get there until around 1am  when are you going home

thanks for including me  i dont think i will be able to make a ski trip durning that period  i have to go to miami and party on south beach  sorry  maybe if something was scheduled around spring skiing febmar  i could definately go  robicheaux is bald  i remember that bastard was so hairy when i was living with him  i used to have to shave the soap in the shower after he used it  i know some of the houston guys would like to go skiing so keep us informed
 

it was ok  we went to the lsu game and lsu lost so we came home that night  what did you do this weekend
 

it is tough to watch because they cant stop shit  i need to email the paper and complain in this article
 

the assets are marked up and we cant sell them  the problem is that we have tapped out our credit lines and we need another 2 billion  seems like we are racing against the clock

sorry i havent called you back  i am in portland  i dont get back until tonight  i will call you when i get home  hope all is well
 

memorial all packed up  we can go out there and just try to get on  hopefully around 230  maybe you can get out early and get our names on
 

i am going to stay here  i am going to the utam game on fri  i am just looking forward to hanging out and relaxing  i need to get some sleep relax and get my mind off of enron  seems like it is day to day on whether or not we are going out of business  it is wearing on me
 

yeah baby  i was there two weeks ago and there were hotties everywhere  i am going to come home in the early part of july and we will figure out the final details
 

your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english  i was wondering why you didnt respond  jury duty sucks huh  have you been going out at all
 

sorry about that  we were running so late and we couldnt find green  we did turn south and drove around until 1230 and figured we were too late  i figured your phone died  we ended up at memorial and i played like shit  i was so dead from the night before  i should have slept all day  we can tee them up sometime soon
 

i told him i didnt think you could make it on sat and that we were both out of town last weekend so we would head up the following sat
 

thanks for that email  i just opened it and everyone say that shoot across all 4 screens of mine  i will talk to you later bc i have to go up to hr now
 

i dont remember half of that night but i do remember you in the bathroom  sierra is fun on wednesdays isnt it
 

i think that all they do is bark and freak out  they arent good dogs  they arent friendly  and i am not angry
 

you think houston is the armpit of the world  i love it hear  the weather sucks in the summer but other than that it is a blast  so you do work for strip clubs huh  that is interesting  what is your stripper name
 

i thought it was  i think that girl is hot  if i won 80million that is the girl i want you to hook up with
 

i need to call that girl tonight  you have got to give them a few days before you call  i wanted to take her out thurs but the stanley cup is on  maybe fri is better  take your girl out then and we can meet up later for drinks

i went to grab some pizza ate and then passed out  those shot i did with those girls wolly knew put me over the edge  sorry about taking off like that  i had a good time but i ran out of energy quick
 

i have a room reserved  it is 160night  we can split it up and pay 40 each which is cheap  i think it is around jan 12th  i have the room from that thurssat
 

i think the best guy to contact is a guy named ted bland or karen buckley  i think he heads up the trading track program  this is the best way to get into trading now  you have to do 3 6mo rotations in different trading support roles  contact him and he should be able to get you more info  hope that helps you out

no problem  hull said it wouldnt be a good party anyway  you know you didnt fall asleep it is called passing out
 

i forgot you had a wedding  i dont go up to austin all that much  i usually stay down here and go out  where do you work up there again  i am sure you told me but i forgot  where are the good places to hang out  is it 4th st

my friends are liars  this past weekend was an anomaly  it isnt bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then  i will be in austin this saturday night so maybe we can get together in austin  we will probably be at it pretty hard again  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street

daily dose on enron  

we are finished  i need to now get a job at house of pies bc that is the only way to pay the bills  the economy is down and when enron collapses the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt  not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks  cant go to anymore lsu games unless i get a free ticket
 

i am just kidding  i wouldnt ever pay for it  anyway i am going with people from work so it woulndt look to good if i was bringing hookers into my room
 

dietzs bachelor party was ok  we did the same thing that we did at vals  i am not going to the tenn game  i might go to the florida game
 

what is shawns cell phone number  he was supposed to stay at my place last night and he didnt show up
 

i am sure they are  houston wont be too affected bc most of the layoffs affect satelite offices  economy should be good here
 

i went to high school in denver  i have only lived here for 2 years  no wonder you hate houston  there is nothing up in north houston
 

they did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset  the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire  skilling and fastow bolted  i have no respect for them  i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 89 but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 80 and we are taken over at 110  not 90 down to 10
 

lets definately go next thurs  i didnt hit it either bc the hockey game was on  did you get a date for tonight  i am going out with one of those pts  let me know and maybe we can meet up
 

i am tired bc i kept waking up with no covers and my butt was hanging off the bed i looked at you and you were covered up to your neck with the covers in the middle of the bed  you look like you slept well
 

lets head up to austin on saturday night  i got an email from that girl at the black swan  she lives in austin but will be at a wedding on sat
 

look damn it they have all the personality in the world and they are not that big  i dont think you know what a cockerspaniel is
 

i live inside the loop here and usually dont leave unless i have to golf  outside of the loop is pretty ugly  which part of houston did you grow up in
 

it depends what type you get  if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere then i cant like that dog  if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place  those little furry dogs act like cats
 

tim should have it  so are you getting nervous  vegas rocked  what time does the wedding start and how long of a drive is it  i bet youre nervous  let me know if we need to keep  a car running out front
 

you didnt have fun at the small town wedding    i had to go to one in mississippi this weekend  it was actually fun   vegas was two weekends ago  that was a blast  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star that weekend  where are you moving  maybe we can get drinks or something this week
 

i am going out tonight to get wasted if anyone is interested  jill allen finishes her cpa today and she and her friends are going to party
 

i didnt want you to go  i was just going to sleep anyway  i was too tired to give you any action  enron is blowing up
 

name

here is the notice that was sent out by pge on friday  this notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow
 

times are getting tight for me  i really liked that house i saw yesterday  i figure since you are not spending money on a dog you can spend it on me
 

comfort suites is like 800 total for 4 nights  cheap as it gets down there  i was just thinking we would all pile in and save some money  only condition is that ryan doesnt go on a booze cruise and piss on himself
 

i think they are all bark and no bite  i think they could get their asses kicked by cats  they look like they were doberman pinchers who were shrunk  you should get a cockerspaniel
 

are you kidding  why would you want a chihuahua  those dogs arent even friendly  do you think they are cool bc of the taco bell dog
 

did you see the article in the journal where calis attorney general said he wants to lock up ken lay enes chairman in a prison cell with a cell mate
 

i am not sure if i am moving or not   i wont know until the beginning of the year  i am back and forth on the decision  i am glad your sis is ok  i did get a room for 160  i am sure i will split it with some of those guys
 

susan forgot to reply to all  i think this was directed at you bass  


susan said
why the heck am i getting all the crap on this oneim not the one who came back to the table with puke on myself
 

i want to see what my market value is  i dont know what is going to happen here  if you want to do a happy hour let me know  maybe tomorrow after work or something  let me know if you are up for it
 

i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place  i think he called but i didnt get the message until sunday  you guys are all welcome to stay at my house  i am sure my parents would love to see you guys again  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old fat and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel  as for robie we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side cart of his dirt bike  when is this trip
 

try his email address which is pederliefkjesethhotmailcom  that is the only way i know how to get in touch with him  i havent booked a flight yet but i will soon
 

i think we might go to the garden in the heights party or rr for halloween  we are going to watch the game first  let me know if you hear of anything else
 

i knew you would bag me again  if you have to work there is nothing you can do about that  i am going to baton rouge on saturday for an engagement party  i will probably go out on friday  when do you get back from chicago  give me a call and maybe we can do something next week
 

does that make a nice scent when baby oil and lotion are mixed  i am first going to rub fake tan all over and then grease up  i am just going to wear my new thong and my new gold bracelet  i am going to look awesome when i am dancing  i dont know what you should be  i think you can do better than gi jane though  you could be an umpalumpa for willy wonka  everyone loves those little guys
 

i think hoskina is having a going away happy hour but after that i am not doing anything  i need to watch hockey
 

coach name haslett had put together the perfect
new orleans saints team
the only thing he was missing was a good quarterback

he had scouted all the colleges and even the high schools
but he couldnt find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a super bowl win

then one night while watching cnn
he saw a warzone scene in bosnia
in one corner of the screen
he spotted a young bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm
he threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15thstory window 200 yards away
kaboom

ive got to get this guy  haslett said to himself
he has the perfect arm
so he brings the kid to the new orleans
and teaches him the great game of football
and the saints go on to win the super bowl
for the first time in history

the young bosnian is canonized
as the great hero of football
and when haslett asks him what he wants
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother
mom he says into the phone
i just won the super bowl
i dont want to talk to you the old woman says
you deserted us  you are not my son
i dont think you understand mother the young man pleads
i just won the greatest sporting event in the world
im here among thousands of my adoring fans
no let me tell you the mother retorts
at this very moment there are gunshots all around us
the neighborhood is a pile of rubble
your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight
the old lady pauses and then tearfully says 
 ill never forgive you for making us move to

i guess that i would look at this a bit differently  we are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa rather it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue  does that matter

good morning

name has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities  we also need to decide how to handle agreements in nonbankrupt entities  we will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company broken down by business unit group name of employee termduration of agreement and future obligations under the agreement

we will need those segregated as follows

employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks
employees involved in newcotrading operations
eel employees
employees remaining in the name estate

could you arrange for this work to be done preferably by tomorrow  i would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others

thanks

name
 

twanda please print this for me  ive been having problems when i try to print  thanks  name

we have decided not to make any reps about these plans since any buyer would not be taking them  however we have a data room list that specifies what was made available and the other side is welcome to review most of what is in that room  we remain cautious about releasing employment compensation data and contract information about individuals but are happy to provide totals of current and future costs under those agreements in the aggregate  let me know if you have questions

which deal are you actively working on  fire or wind  do i need to be working on the draft agreement

thanks

name
 

i think we have had our release reviewed by ny counsel already but it might be a belts and suspenders idea to have drew look at it quickly

i agree with lizzettes view of the persons who dont sign the release i believe that they probably have quit  if however they rescind their application before termination it is not a voluntary term  if the situation arises however i think we should reevaluate at that time

name

well id better get back to it

fyi i talked this morning with a guy who took the mexico cruise the week of thanksgiving last year  he gave me some scoop on the trip  the weather is nice but wind causes things to be chilly  lots of good food

one thing  the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea  you may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids and probably call your doc for some meds for youas i recall you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid

i have just learned that the holland club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes  st name arrives at 1030 so cameron probably wouldnt get his gift until 1100 at the earliest  also since it is out in the boonies it would take a while to get back inside the loop  

would it be possible for us to arrive late  id hate to create a disturbance but i think cameron would like to attend both things

thanks

name

thanks so much for sending me your friends resume  he certainly has a strong academic and work history

unfortunately it is not names practice to hire attorneys right out of law school  we prefer that our candidates have at least 46 years minimum experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here  the rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training which is critical for new lawyers nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who dont have the requisite experience

so please thank your friend for his interest  if you would like i would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school  alternatively he may be a candidate for the associate and analyst program if he doesnt want to practice law

call me with any questions

name
 

please send her our standard confidentiality agreement that we attach to the consulting services agreement  ok to send it by email thanks

name
 

this looks fine  have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed  i dont want there to be any other surprises so id like to include known and unknown type language here  also does the definition of ect include all parents shareholders affiliates employees attorneys etc  lets be very clear  id also like a covenant not to sue signed by both clonch and his attorneys
 

i dont know if you heard but name and i spoke with him and he is ok with everything  i guess you can consider this one closed except that i would appreciate it if you would complete a performance review on him and forward it to name and me for review and placement in the file  thanks
 

hello all

name

late last week i received a call from name kracraft who does employment law at dynegy  she indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from dynegy to name or vice versa  of course such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of freeforall  at a minimum i would think that you and name lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions  with that thought i have asked name orourkes team to work on such a protocol

in the meantime name mentioned that one person in name shapiros group wants to go to dynegy  she understood that shapiro had said it was ok  do you know about that  if not should you give name a call about it  i am concerned about the floodgate effect so i believe we should proceed with extreme caution

let me know your thoughts on this  

name
 

the minimum number of days should be 21 and they should have 7 days to revoke it  although the adea probably would not apply to aa candidates it could be an issue for the rest of the organization  name
 

thanks for the resume  this persons background wont work for us  we need more transactional work experience for them to be successful here particularly ma major real estate financing etc  thanks  name
 

i will provide more detailed comments later but want to clarify that the severance plan has not been adopted by all name entities domestically  similarly some nameowned companies have adopted their own vacation sick pay etc  so we should be careful about the audience for these communications  i suggest getting with name johnson on that issue  name
 

name

i have been getting this question a lot

it has been communicated to every employee that if they are in category 5 they will get a pip  therefore i recommend putting one in place  if you are more comfortable you can rename it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period  something like performance objectives or something to that effect 

because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan we really should follow through

name
 

i guess i would delay in responding to this one until we know what the plan will look like  hate to direct them to current plan if it will be changing  name
 

i am happy for us to paper the deal  i am not sure that we will be able to guarantee anything special for scarth in the event of a purchase of the assets  it will be a deal team decision as to whether they want to impose that requirement on the sale of the asset  name
 

i understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter  our practice and intent has been to pay after they start and i believe that the letter refers to payment after they start so there is some wiggle room on the other side

i agree that it is not a slam dunk on our part but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim  we then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed  in the meantime i am comfortable with this level of risk

of course if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue

yall let me know if you disagree
 

name

as mentioned in my voice mail on friday we have received a lawsuit filed by name lindert against name corp eeso and ees inc in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions  he seeks damages of 1 million

name name passed this lawsuit to me but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of ees  

i have contacted chicago counsel for information not retention purposes to determine the answer date which is 30 days  i do not believe that we have been properly served however so we appear to have additional time  the suit was filed 111 and we received it sometime last week via cover letter to name lay from lindert rather bizzarre if you ask me 

the law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiffs firm it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in cook county

the case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship  according to the seyfarth shaw lawyers i contacted on friday the circuit court of cook county law division is not a place where we would want to be and federal court is preferable  we have 30 days to remove to federal court

let me know how you want me to proceed

you need more than the 840 for this  you also need the it personnel  ill forward those to name so she can get started  thanks  name
 

i have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the ecoelectrica offices  it looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials  mere possession of these materials is a violation of law  our outside counsel called the fbi which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there it does not have  a duty to report it

we also received advice that the puerto name office of the fbi might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved  our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local fbi office and talk with a duty agent  the number is 7877546000  given the situation of the possible sale however we may choose not to take that route

in any event if we dont report it all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible

name
 

that is a close call  has he already called on the acquiring company  if so then i would think it would be ok  if not i dont think that he could contact his friends who used to be at novarco simply because they were acquired  that to me would violate the spirit of the affidavit language particularly if richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through novarco

we could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted

name
 

you should indicate that the severance plan is subject to the approval of the name corp board of directors  we do have a plan in place but we havent terminated any employees under that plan  in the last few weeks  so we cant say that there is not plan in place righ now  name

today i received a demand from name biesers attorney  he basically wants a years pay plus supervesting of options which i told him was impossible  i have given name a more detailed email with the specifics of his demand  let me know if you want to know the details

in any event name will not be returning to the office at all

this will just be rome and name  although we believe that most of his claims really are against hms his lawyer is claiming that name used hms to defraud rome  his lawsuit will be against only name  therefore it makes no sense to drag hms into this at this point although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed

name

i guess i think that it is not worth the fight these days  i suppose would approve this training but i think we need to have an understanding w ogletree about travel time travel expenses billing rates etc  they need to understand who holds the purse strings and i do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training  or could send me or lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only    for your information name there is nothing magic about the training they are doing  it is standard training that i used to deliver frequently when i was in private practice  ogletree does not have a monopoly on it

name

thanks for passing this message on  it is good to know what is on the rumor mill and nobody who knows what i do ever passes those on to me directly

i believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on midyear prc as that would not be the best legal defense to have   

instead hr with assistance from legal has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees if any will be affected  listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors ability to perform several different types of jobs business knowledge leadership teamwork and historical performance over the last 18 months  prc results would not be the sole factor  otherwise someone who is the only person who knows how to do a missioncritical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at midyear review  that result obviously would be disasterous

you asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance  

the bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows

	provided that name meets its earnings targets and provided that employee is rated within the top 25 of the performance criteria under names annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question employees annual bonus amounts under the plan for calendar years 2001 2002 and 2003 payable in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively shall be based on an annual bonus target of 

this language does not address a persons performance as compared to ones peers but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25 of those criteria  thus if there are only 3 rating categories ie 1 2 3 distributed as 108010 then only the people in the top category would be within the top 2533 of the rating criteria  

given the huge change in our process however there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead we should look at the top 25 of the peer group instead of performance criteria even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted

as a result i would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories ie 2a 2b or 2c  that way persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2a would be eligible for the target bonus  if there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high for those employees a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 108010 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75 of the categories under that process  

of course it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race sex national origin age etc in this process

please let me know if you have any questions
 

name i spoke with lara robinson this morning she indicated that the indemnities in the contribution agmt covered the matters addressed in this draft and that she was told no more indemnities were to be made she also wants us to hire everyone who is out on leave immediately instead of having them show up when released even if the person never returns due to a conversion to ltd she wants us to pick up responsibility for those employees seems unusual to me would you please give me a call at your earliest convenience my number is 7132187155 thanks name
 

why does this person need expertfinder  i didnt get a specific reason from prior emails  if he needs to locate people shouldnt peoplefinder do it for him  more information would be helpful in making the determination of whether to allow him access  thanks  name
 

in general if a person turns down an offer to go to a divested company it is considered a voluntary terminationresignation we havent made that decision here though 

as to solicitation of employees back and forth it will be a negotiated deal term i cant recall if we put any provision on that issue in the bid template or not let me know if you want me to check the latest version

attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas efs under the new nymex rules  please review the redlined language

the new nymex amendment permitting efs transactions was originally part of a pilot program for name crude contracts nymex rule 621 effective september 5 2001

nymex notice no 01372 effective november 1 2001discusses the application of the efs for natural gas futures contracts but i cannot find a specific reference to a nymex rule i assume it is nymex rule 621  thus i didnt know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule

i also didnt know if i need to reference the number of nymex contracts in my special provisions section

further if rule 621 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts then i suppose that the confirm should  recite the information required of the clearing member by the exchange  on the other hand maybe the clearing members report should contain information such as appearing in rule 621ac if applicable and it need not be repeated in the confirmation

can you give this a quick review  trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so  thanks
 

please send me the transaction referenced in the termination  thanks  name

per our conversation attached is a short recap of the companies and amounts involved

with respect to prime brokerage accounts the following approximate cash balances are held by bear stearns  co bear in accounts for the following companies

name north america corp	159022		filing debtor

ect investments inc		392397084		has not filed

name credit inc		10500000		has not filed

i understand that one of our uk companies name credit limited has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the name credit inc cash and was told that bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by name credit limited to bear under otc trades approx 1500000 for a net balance of approx 9000000

ect investments inc sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on november 30 2001 requesting return of its cash balance  i do not believe that ect investments inchas any otc trades with bear but i will need to verify

we would like to resolve the return of cash issues  please feel free to contact me

i wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before i considered your annex a which i would like to compare to the ena current version  we are currently considering more revisions so your annex a will help me to think a bit

i have attached a redline of the actual confirm without annex a  a couple of thoughts
1	for purposes of creating a template i gave a choice for termination date
2	i collapsed payment dateinvoice because im concerned that ejc may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
3	we need to fix the floating price language  i dont know where the reference to north sea west africa mediterranean comes from  i didnt see it in marketwire and london doesnt use it  also the conversion language is vague ie ttm ttb and tts are not defined but i suspect they refer to bidmidsell  are they references on the bank of tokyomitsubishi ltd screen  also it may be better to create a conversion reference to your central bank and not a particular banking institution you could get caught later dealing with that bank using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage
4	i didnt see your schedule 1 guarantee but i assume that it is the normal ene format 

regarding annex a i quickly noticed an issue with the tibor definition which uses quite a bit of isda language which can be easily fixed with an appropriate isda reference  give me another day or so to comment

let me know if youd like to talk  my home number is 7136643207 if youd like to call

name  which lawyers should be involved  what is a reasonable timetable  lets talk and also talk about utility service companies  thx  ss
 

name

i do have comments to this confirm  i have never seen your isda master agreement master so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict  

1	is suntrust the calc agent under your master should they be agent for this deal

2	need to upgrade definitions to 2000 definitions the 1991 and 1998 definitions have been superseded

3	are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by suntrust in the manner set out there is no valuation or payment timedate for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option  this language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind

4	do you have existing transactions with suntrust on your books in addition to this one

5	are there any additional termination events under the master  you dont want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring  also it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with suntrust is related to the loan agreement for purposes of giving suntrust the right to terminate  is it

6	defining an event as either an event of default or a termination event has different settlement consequences  it looks like youre not concerned as to how suntrust values terminated transactions if this deal is related to the loan agreement i think part 2d would be clearer if stated as

additional termination event will apply  the following shall constitute an additional termination event with respect to the counterparty cite events i and ii if accurate   for the purpose of the foregoing termination event the affected party shall be the counterparty

this means suntrust will calculate as if you were in default  or do you want to calculate at mid

6	you should delete par 2a  i dont believe you have agreed to do this in the past but perhaps you do not mind  your lawyer should review the impact of stating this provision shall constitute an additional agreement for the purpose of section 4 of the swap agreement

7	are the economics of the deal stated correctly

8	what transactions are being superseded  has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained

name and name

legal would like to speak with one of you about the chase and morgan issues surrounding the master netting agreement requests  there seems to be some confusion  i think the chase request came from credit and the morgan request came directly from morgan  the items below summarize what i know about the two different counterparties

1  at the request of chase and with names approval ena terminated the morgan guaranty trust company of new york master energy price swap agreement  all outstanding trades have been transferred to the april 5 1994 interest rate and currency exchange agreement between the chase manhattan bank and ena the chase master  when the merger is complete anticipated around november 10 2001 the survivor jp morgan chase bank will be enas counterparty under the chase master see letter agreement dated october 24 2001

2  the chase master has been amended several times most recently to provide for fx forward trades and resolve multibranch issues

3  chase recently agreed that ena propose a new isda schedulecsa  legal has requested a credit worksheet

4  among other things it appears that the chase master currently provides for first method  this has never been amended

5  the chase master is used for fxrate and commodity trades

on a different note

5  morgan name capital group inc has signed mininetting agreements with ectric  morgan now wants to sign similar mininetting agreements with erac and egli  i believe that name viverito is working on these agreements  morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ena but would like to see our master netting agreement and may decide to execute  three outstanding elfi financial trades will be reconfirmed under ena and i am waiting for morgan to forward that documentation

6  both ena and name corp have been in the process of negotiating isda agreements with morgan name capital services inc  nothing has been executed  ectric has an executed isda with that entity

7  the names morgan name  co inc and morgan name  co international limited also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary

question  the master netting agreement assignment list contains the name jpmorgan  legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the jp morgan chase master netting agreement  

question  does credit also want to send a master netting agreement to morgan  or should legal merely send morgan a blank template to see if morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement

sorry for the length of this message but the word morgan raises all kinds of questions  i hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved
 

name  name is looking into this one which appears to have been executed  name

name ma is currently in transit back to new york  although she doesnt know who i am i will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation  you should do the same by email voice mail and fax  i suggest a deadline for ey to respond to you since i was told in a voice mail from name buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on friday december 21  i am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but i would alert ey to the reasons why you need their approval for which there is no written procedure immediately or else your value evaporates  there is nothing that i can do if ey is slow to respond  in that situation i suppose i would keep calling the ey new york office to request immediate attention to your situation  by the way i was unable to return names message since i received it about 10 minutes ago and its very late in the uk

i am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group

in the past we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth business day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month  as a practical matter calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last business day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps

how do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month  is this a cash flow issue  do i need to involve someone from treasury or settlements

please let me know  thanks

im away monday and tuesday in brazil  i thought i would give you things that im waiting on or that we should meet about next week

1  your group was going to give back the assetsbalance sheet stuff in 3 formats

2  on south america  lots of stuff but well talk when i get back  most importantly that i get an income statement that looks like north america

		  they did a trade with me thats up 8 million for them this is fine but the negative pl was not showing up in na  the positive pl was showing up in south america we should make sure this trade does not get cash settled  the last thing i want is cash going to sa on an internal trade

		
3  cross commodity book  i have 19 million of losses that were last year that they found in january  put this in the tbg line and change the line name to other   in the footnotes we will explain all others  im sure there is a million things to come

4  we also need to improve the footnotes section you gave to me

5  ive set up a meeting with youmedeffner and name on this 15 capital charge  we should come up with another methodology

thats all i can think of now

name aronld was curious about the outsourcing deals we were pursuing  could you please update him on the deals we are getting close on

name
 

on wednesday we will be having a mini trading track interview session  the quality may not resemble the first session we had but i thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program  we will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join  i had a couple of observations from last time

1  i think we were too hard on external candidates  there are 5 or 6 external candidates  remember that they dont have the name grounding that the internal candidates have  most of them are not in the gas or electricity industry  try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities

2  some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo  that doesnt mean that they will not be good traders one day i think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow

with respect to the ppa reserve

we need to adjust the usd reserved based on the currency  we decided not to hedge the currency when we took the reserve  its hard to make an objective decision on whether this is correct or not  however the currency was 15 cad to 1 usd when we did it and now 1565 cad to 1 usd so the reserve would be 2875 usd not 300  we should just adjust this weekly or monthly

these are useful updates  please include whalley lavorato parquet dietrich delainey kitchens haedicke sanders kirby sharp leff calger belden etc on future updates  thanks
 

i think it would be a good idea for them to talk but i wouldnt want name to go to california right now  maybe they could meet outside the state if for example brown is going to be in dc or new york or by phone
 

great news  with respect to the commissoners i think it makes sense to go back through name and ask if she could set up meetings with a few commissioners ater the staff briefing
 

name  please forward to name kirby
i think the draft looks good  could you also prepare a draft of the letter we discussed yesterday to convey the proposal to the committee
 

my comments are attached  i think the pleading is well written but as youll see from my comments i believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading
 

the letter looks good  a couple of comments for your consideration

on page three we describe the change to the definition of public utility and then argue that we dont fit into it  would it be worth explaining why that makes sense  specifically the new jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power and gas businesses  economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business eg distribution  the competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities  therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service  what those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers  the same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive  the generation and sales business has a competitive structure ie relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc  these components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service  they do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions  competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service  because regulators dont set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations  indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale
as a former practicing lawyer i certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative  but i question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light which these documents have a habit of doing   i can just see the press seizing on names claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion  i suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of pd  if we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the publics resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances
 

im glad things are moving forward  ive talked with name briefly and will follow up with him again
 

attached are some late night thoughts on the portal  most of this is focussed on the portal for opinion leaders but some of it could be applicable to the comemrcial portal as well

could you forward this to name  for some reason my address book doesnt pull him up when im off the system

federal price limits backfire
some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps
name lazarus chronicle staff writer
wednesday july 4 2001
2001 san name chronicle 
url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifile3dchroniclearchive20010704mn186091dtl 
officials in california and nevada after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap western power prices warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states
the warnings were issued as california came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the firstever rolling blackouts in las vegas forced energyhungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning
the two states are asking the federal energy regulatory commission to take a closer look at the socalled price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages
we need some clarity to this order said name hidalgo a spokesman for the california department of water resources which is spending billions of dollars to keep the states lights on
generators need to be held accountable he said
the crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at belowmarket rates during periods of high demand
some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost
no ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said name ackerman executive director of the western power trading forum an energyindustry association in menlo park
ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect
this means individual regions like california or las vegas could end up not having enough ackerman said it increases the threat of blackouts
blackout alert canceled
california authorities issued a blackout alert at 145 pm yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels they canceled the alert about an hour later after finding additional supplies
everyone in the west is fighting for megawatts said name mccorkle a spokeswoman for the california independent system operator which oversees the states power network
the golden states latest brush with lightsout conditions came a day after nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the mgm grand and caesars palace to dim their lights
name soderberg chairman of the nevada public utilities commission said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating mondays shortage
were looking very closely at this he said there seems to be a potential for unintended consequences
specifically soderberg said nevada is focusing on operators of older less efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing under capped prices
were going to see how the caps might have played into this he said
the federal ceiling in 10 western states excluding california is about 92 per megawatt hour in california a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the states credit risk bringing the price to just over 101
ackerman at the western power trading forum said regional price controls have extended californias power crisis to neighboring states
california sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said
lawyers looking for loopholes
california and nevada officials however said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output
the generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said hidalgo at the department of water resources
unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance for months federal regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs
hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output monday california officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the federal energy regulatory commission in case of emergencies
no one answered he said they were closed
state officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter they were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response

outofstate generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
by dale kasler
bee staff writer
published july 3 2001
confused by the federal governments new controls on electricity prices generators withheld so much power from california on monday that the state was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts state officials said
the confusion began when the states electric grid operators declared a stage 1 power alert in the early afternoon triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect june 21
outofstate generators pulled about 1500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon enough to power about 11 million homes because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new federal energy regulatory commission pricing system said name hidalgo spokesperson for the state department of water resources the department buys electricity for the states financially distressed utilities
they didnt understand what they were going to be paid there was confusion over the ferc order hidalgo said we saw 1500 megawatts disappear
the problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the west which forced california to compete with other states for scarce electricity he said rolling blackouts hit southern nevada
most california officials credit the ferc system which is based on a variable price cap with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power market but power generators have complained that the price caps by limiting profits could discourage the production of critically needed electricity and as mondays episode suggested even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages
thats the risk that you run with price controls said name oname editor of the newsletter california energy markets people want any kind of certainty at all
hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of lastminute imports from the bonne07ville power administration the federal agency that markets governmentproduced hydroelectric power in the pacific northwest the state went into a stage 2 power alert the nexttolast level before blackouts are ordered the alert was canceled in late afternoon
the blackouts would have been the first in california since may 8
ferc imposed a roundtheclock ceiling on power throughout the west the price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the leastefficient plant operating in california during a power alert declared by the independent system operator which runs the states powertransmission grid when theres no alert prices cant exceed 85 percent of the cap that was established during the latest alert
until monday the maximum price held steady at about 101 a megawatthour in california but when the iso declared a stage 1 power alert in early afternoon signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand confusion set in hidalgo and others said
because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas which fuels many california power plants suppliers knew the cap would fall but no one knew by how much until the price was posted by the iso
the ceiling for california fell to about 77 at 3 pm but was back up to 98 in two hours according to the iso those prices include the 10 percent premium that sellers can charge california because ferc said theres a credit risk in selling to the state
oname said its likely suppliers will pull back from the market every time the iso declares a power alert
instate generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the iso but outofstate suppliers can withhold supplies and on monday it was the outofstaters that were pulling back hidalgo said

power sales halted by new pricing curbs
electricity confused suppliers unsure what they will be paid refuse to sell to state which asks ferc for a ruling but doesnt get it

by nancy vogel times staff writer

     sacramentoconfusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity sellers to back away from sales to california on monday afternoon pushing the state closer to blackouts energy officials said
     the state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply more than 1 million homes said name hart deputy director of the california department of water resources which has been buying much of the states electricity since january
     at least five companies producing or marketing power are telling us that since they dont know what theyre going to get paid theyre not going to take the risk and so theyre not going to sell the energy hart said
     the electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a stage 1 emergency meaning reserves had dipped below 7 it was the first such emergency since may 31
     under a june 19 order by the federal energy regulatory commission intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the west a power emergency in california triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power plant owners from washington to arizona
     the new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most inefficient expensive power plant selling electricity to california grid operators during the first full hour of a stage 1 emergency
     but much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commissions order and that apparently drove away sellers hart said
     shortly after the state issued the stage 1 alert at 130 pm putting the old price limit of 90 per megawatthour in question companies that had committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour monday afternoon backed out hart said the companies include transalta energy marketing of oregon constellation power of baltimore and sempra energy trading a unit of the san namebased energy conglomerate
     forced to dip even deeper into the states power reserves and declare a stage 2 emergency water agency officials called the federal energy commissions hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it should take effect they got no answer
     hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify their order today one outstanding question is what obligations power suppliers have to deliver electricity to california in an emergency
     both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price when it is set will probably be lower than 90 per megawatthour because the price of natural gas the main fuel in california power plants has dropped lately
     temperatures soared several degrees higher monday than grid operators had anticipated but they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the bonneville power administration in portland ore had agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of pacific northwest hydropower each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from california later this summer
     bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through hart said

just got your email address  read below

right now i guess we have 6  i have not heard back from boone  val said he would stop by if they were back in town by then  i didnt have mitchs email so you may want to forward to him and i will talk to hull

i guess we could have about 10 people

what do you think
 

sounds like a good job i am glad you are enjoying it  i havent taken any big vacations lately mostly to austin  i did go to new orleans for a wedding recently but other than that nothing  the girls sound like they are well  tell them i said hi

good talking to you
e
 

whatever babe  i am concerned but not to the point of worrying my brains out  like you  i tend to trust the doctor in matters such as these like when i had chest pains the doctor ran tests to rule out significant problems and did notice an abnormality on one test  instead of running out and panicking i waited and took the tests again and they were normal  now i am not advocated waiting for the next test if that makes you uncomfortable  you should do what you want to do but i guess what i am saying is that you are not going to die  so stop worrying and let the tests confirm or deny any problem
 

just put it in the system  the league has a waiver process  you need to have your transactions in by noon thursday
 

supposedly i have reversible airway disease which is not asthma but similar  they have given me an inhaler and some claritin for allergies


i havent been able to find anything on the internet about it though
 

i have made reservations for names bachelor party  you are the chosen few  the cruise is set for sat jan 19 at 7 pm out of freeport  transportation will be arranged for you  we need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th  i will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future email  the final tally will be 32 a person i have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and i can promptly blow all of that money on gambling  sadly the gourmet dinner was not available on the freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner

let me know if you have any questions

i believe what name name was referring to is the termination of tws shared cost surcharge effective october 31 2001  i dont think there would be any system changes required  typically tws rates are entered with a start and end date and if this is correct the surcharge should have an end date of 10312001 and there wouldnt be anything else to do  if its not entered that way an end date could be entered now whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level  the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts and that should take care of it

name  is this correct  i know youre on a project please let me know if you can check this or who can

thank you
name
 

you are correct  ive got my units confused  the amount on slide 11 should be 110 mmcfd  

on the san name slide 14 ive left out a phrase from the report  the report reads  total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 43 bcfcd and is expected to decline almost 22  about 24 per year to 34 bcfcd by 2010  in the tabular information of the study 1999 begins with 4306 mmcfd and 2010 ends with 3351 mmcfd
 

i have reviewed the la plata facilities oo agreement  lee could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment  it appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following

special services  this would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the operator tw and the operating committee tw  nwplrepresentatives  if nwpl agreed their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest  if we did obtain their approval future om cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners  weve agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 35 escalator starting in 2001 

addition or expansion  demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity we have to give notice to nwpl and they have 60 days to participate  if they participate they share in the cost at their ownership interest but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest  if they dont indicate a desire to participate in 60 days we can proceed with the expansion without any approval but also no cost sharing  also any incremental om associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion

i think if we went the special services route we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels  i think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost  they probably dont have 260000 15mm  174 sitting around in a budget somewhere that theyd like to fork over for these facilities  name what do you think  how difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities

recommendation  to save us the 60 days notice period of an expansion i think we should notify them that its a necessary special service and ask for approval  to pass along their share of the cost but to be prepared to eat 100 of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities  in this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future om attributable to these facilities

fyi their ownership interest is still officially 223 since they have not executed the amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times first by me and twice by name blair  if	they execute the amendment that incorporates the 4198 expansion of the facilities their ownership interest will be 174
 

in an effort to get cash in the door for tw and to maximize revenue opportunity for tw in the coming year i think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the ferc as soon as possible 

one would be the oba filing we have been discussing and trying to support with historical data to get automatic cashout on obas in constrained areas on tw

second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate ft points  this may be the time the market to california is not so hot to try to implement this  i know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them  

name is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the oba tariff filing  could we discuss scheduling alternate ft by price at the same meeting
 

heres the spreadsheet with numbers for the 3 cases  please refer to the assumptions tab updated numbers in the summary fuel price  rates tabs

jan
	i had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together but i wasnt sure if it was the final actuals for 2001  what was tws total actual throughput for 2001
 

my other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows

section 352
	2nd paragraph 3rd sentence  explanation of incremental revenue  when we talk about revenues which tw already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period  what if were taking bids on future capacity and were trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges were not necessarily being paid yet  the language is so specific  can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what tw already has contractually committed

	2nd paragraph last sentence  the phrase guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate  what does this mean  tk  i were both a littles confused by this language

	4th paragraph 4th sentence  the phrase the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline  tk is the phrase published indices generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes  i realize it will probably have to be something that is published
 

the last slide im working on is the detail of market value slide  i have a draft completed but name has not been able to review it  as long as i can get time with him in the morning and the changes arent significant i should be able to have the presentation to you
 

you had asked to see a final copy of our presentation  this is what was sent to tracy today  we may have a couple of inserts by friday

name had asked me whether this contract had rofr or not because he thinks it should be terminated but cas is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a rofr flag on it in cbs  i think that this contract does not have rofr but could you confirm this for me  if my memory is correct i thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk  more recently tk to roll for another month or so  if im thinking of the right contract that would mean that it did not have a rofr because it was not for a year or longer and that it terminated 3312001

could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term  if not then this agreement should not have the rofr contract on it

let me know  thanks

we have not been billing interest  the system does not generate an interest invoice until the disputed amount is paid  then based upon when its paid the interest is calculated
 

sorry  here are the bullets 
 2500 mile pipeline extending from west texas to the california border with 17 bcfday of peak capacity
 maximum rate environment due to increased california demand
 bidirectional flow capabilities provides flexibility to rapidly adapt regional demand
 over 90 of revenues from demand charges
 western deliveries fully subscribed through dec 2005 eastern deliveries fully subscribed through dec 2002 wellpositioned for recontracting
 no new rate case until november 2006
 overbuilding into cal can compromise resubscription of contracts not unique to tw

the slide includes these bullets a map of tw and a barchart with 19992001 throughput  i asked name to change the 90 to 80 in 4th bullet  how do you feel about the maximum rate environment  bullet
 

i have provided to tws gas logistics group copies of the following facility related agreements

	la plata facilities ownership  operating agreement between twpl  northwest pipeline dated november 3 1995

i talked with name about this bullet  lets insert the phrase due to capitalizing on market volatility
 

jan 
	what percentage of our revenues from from demand charges in 2001  name has a bullet here that says over 90  is this in the ballpark
 

the revenue impact of the inservice delay of the red name expansion is as follows

	 volume			plan		revenue	month	

trsp	13300d	44 days		  05		 30000	june  july
fuel	    341d	30 days		257		 26000	june
fuel	    341d	14 days		264		 13000	july

trspfuel	40000d	30 days		    0		      0		june  made no subscription assumption in plan
trsp	40000d	14 days		 38		213000	july
fuel	  1026d	14 days		264		 38000	july
							
total							320000

fuel calculated at 25 upside
 

attached is the spreadsheet updated for the i to i deals  please see the first tab for summarized info
 

thats what i was asking jan previously  does the 18 bcfd include any estimates or is that an actual number

name i am waiting for name to respond to two emails ive sent him requesting comments on the slide  he is in dallas today
 

per our conference call today here are some ideas to get tw settlement value

1	socal to commit to tw to let us schedule transport at the socaltopock south needles delivery point

2	socal to turnback 20000 to 25000d of receipt capacity from the wtx pool at no cost to tw socal continues to pay for it

3	tw has been scheduling pges payback to socal at socaltopock to help pge and socal  socal to schedule this as transport from pgetopock as a rp to socaltopock dp and pay tw transport fee

4	socal to agree in writing to dedicate to tw the incremental 50000d at needles becoming available jan 2002 until red name expansion inservice

5	socal to amend their oba to dollarvalued from volumetric and cashout their existing oba with tw at tws index value

6	socal to sell storage to tw

7	socal to purchase incremental thoreau to west of thoreau capacity from tw

8	extension of socals mainline or san name lateral contracts  or early notice of termination or early notice of rofr trigger so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it
 

name asked me for a copy of the offer we sent to socal on the billing issue  i must have deleted the email  do you still have it electronically  if so could you forward it to name  hes interested in the excel spreadsheet with the  impact

thanks
name
 

this is my understanding too  we can discount gri away and we only have to pay the gas research institute what we collect  we have to pay the aca if we discount it away

one more check would be name doll  name
 

how does this look

 

also i did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet

	the name to blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding rofr capacity in the supporting sheet  i changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities which include rofr capacity

	name had made some assumptions about east of thoreau capacity subscription such as the usgt 400000d contract would remain subscribed it doesnt 	have rofr and she had included the extension of 23 other contracts that dont have rofr  these contracts were then dropped after 2005  i continued the 	extensions through 2006

	i changed the east of thoreau capacity to 750000d from 850000d

the only thing i have to add if this is our premise name field services is not an owner of the blanco hub  only pnm nwpl and transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline  im wondering if its appropriate for wfs to have a hub agreement if the purpose is for the operator tw to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners capacity
 

per our discussions yesterday i did find an iroquois gas transmission system lp order on rehearing in my file dated august 5 1997 in docket no rp97126002 80 ferc p61199 concerning scheduling alt ft by price  on reviewing it again some key points were  

	allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate  the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights
	the commission maintains that all firm capacity once scheduled be curtailed pro rata without regard to price

panhandle also filed on march 14 1997 for scheduling alt ft by price at docket no rp97291 its referenced in footnotes but i dont have a copy of the filing
 

its just one slide  the 2nd bullet is true in the recent past but not necessarily going forward  id have to check with jan tomorrow if the 4th bullet is in the ballpark  neither of these bullets represent a timeframe  name said this is very high level  i guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat  let me know if you have comments  name said she had been running this all past name

okay  ive already drafted some marketing strategy stuff that names reviewing  let me know when you want to get together to discuss
 

we held a meeting to discuss the status of tws 637 imbalance filing  our current position after discussions about a month ago has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stirup segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie  we discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our oba wish list outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing

after further discussion we decided that the one thing most narrowly defined that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cashout in constrained areas  if defined this narrowly this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data  we think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing

name  name are going to discuss with mkm and teb with name  lyn  terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe name to blanco blanco to thoreau thoreau to the border  check with name for any other areas that should be included and increased imbalance levels  we plan to get together next week to discuss further

concerning the rest of our oba wish list we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a settlement position on those issues to have ready in the event of commission action in this docket
 

it had come up in a meeting that tw was being allocated some  associated with nng personnel probably storage desk in name  omaha and risk management people  is there anyway that you can tell us the people partial people who are being allocated to tw
 

i dont know if name has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with wtx pool capacity and about that name contract you mentioned in our staff mtg yesterday but i looked at my notes and this is what i come up with

the name contract that expires 7312002 without rofr is already taken into consideration as expired in the november 2002 capacity of 17300d we derived last week which weve already sold 20000d to calpine  ppl

other contracts expiring in 2002  early 2003 from the wtx pool are

	25841	pge	17200d	10312002	rofr trigger 103101
	26511	pge	  8165d	10312002	rofr trigger 103101
	total		25365d

	26683	aps	8000d		3312003	subject to rofr
		
otherwise we have wtx pool capacity every aproct of 14000d opposite of swgs seasonal ctrc

the other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement  for the month of november 2002 for example we have 22000d of capacity we are including in our wt1 total that is made up of southward paths 20000d for usgt  2000d for astra with receipts north of wt1 for delivery to wtx delivery points south of wt2  this is the most conservative capacity reservation policy  in the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of wt1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of wt1 we would need to compress gas south through wt1 to make deliveries for these two contracts  we may want to reassess this
 

please let me know a soon as possible this morning by 930 if possible what the annual dollars are we collect from nwpl  pnm for the blanco hub and from nwpl for the la plata facilities  i need the total dollars both the operating and market services together  i just need a ballpark number  whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the blanco hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the la plata facilities

thank you

fyi  i have done the west and i have resaved this file out there  i highlighted the rows to be changed in yellow  if we all do this we should be able to use the same list  i added a column to the file and put im sb lt sb and daily sb  
name
 

attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily  i made this extremely simple on our first pass but i left in the tabs that were in the oldcurrent file  all you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locationsyellow column  this will then set the gas daily curve  we will continue to true up to gas daily each day  you may want to also reset the next days curve as well since this is a hardcode you simply type over the previous days load  the phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it  we can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like  i figure you will want to keep your model and i can pull info from there as well  i simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs  please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it  thanks

i have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 20 minutes  i cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill  my service was cancelled immediately and i was told i would receive a bill from you and i would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited  i asked at that time since i had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that i would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour  your customer service manager very rudely i might add  said that was impossible and i would just have to do it anyway  since i have had to wait on hold today for so long i want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and i did not get the use of my phone  

just a word of advice i would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve  this is by far the worst customer service experience i have ever had with a company and i will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience  i understand that you dont really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers but i assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers

here in lies the problem  these fix price locks are not deal specific  rather counterparty specific  therefore we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not  this means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing  for every month since may  except september we have been able to do this  it just so happens the one time we do not do it we had the most locks  the problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit chicago  same deals different issues  thanks

i think the only other solution is to post two curves one with an sp and one with pr  you should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type pr and have it look to the sp curve   then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value just two different risk types  the only other option i see is to change the deals back to the old aeco curve that we used prior to this

i think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and i thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region  these relate to fixed price lock ins with peoples  i think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month  we will have to try and work on this for this month  the problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled  sorry for the confusion

that is understood    he will be taking glisans position which had the same restrictions on it    i dont plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions   there would be no purpose in giving him ef data 

by the wya name needs to do the marketing affiliate stuff
 

this message was sent earlier today to the financeaccountingoperational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow  your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time
 

why do our numbers look so high in the 4th quarter and then fall off so much     we have to get a better handle on all of this and fast
 

i am getting ready to announce that i am bringing name name into egs as vice president of finance and transaction support    thinking about the current organization do think it appropriate to consider putting ms fischer in his organization   the kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have name working with corp on   i will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others    we will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves    his group will be providing services to all but i am willing to carve out some priorities
 

arent you being a little rough on her on a problem that really doesnt make any difference to dynegy
 

yes  they want us to record the amounts loaned normal loans as a reduction of equity if ene does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability  they do not want to count the 15b or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes  they are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes
 

i will submit that that may be the case today  i am only concerned that when the situation changes that we will not be willing to discuss the opposite and the question still remains as to what the form 2 regulatory will require
 

we are following the issue and i believe ingaa is going to be filing somethiong that we have had input on
 

on the other deal they are back to total capital expenditures and not just expansion dollars  i will need you to resurrect your language on the gas for name tomorrow
 

not at this time   i think as long as name is performing im not sure why there is all of this noise
 

this position is truly needed in omaha to provide support as name suggests    i only wish there was a way to move someone from here to there
 

can you 2 help her out here    i believe the footnotes probably cover it but to the extent you have more it would be helpful
 

you might say that we are lending the money to name and therefore are now looking further than nng and tw
 

i have asked and will let you know the answer later today    the bigger question is that they can not loan money to name and can only dividend so if they can do something to raise the cash they still cant get it out any more out than they can by dividending    the other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred and were advised to wait   their receivables from california are part of the problem   more update later
 

name   can you help me figure out who i need to talk to to get the deals we did with you as ect back in 1999 modified
 

i think there is still the possibility that just like has happened to el paso that enforcement could still open the case since ferc is still out trying to find a way to get us   it is true that the alj did not help them out but that decision is not binding upon the commission    neither name drew or i are comfortable yet that we have the win  we are pleased with the alj decision but know that the alj did not get to the answer the commission intended
 

i would like to but we may have to put it off until next week    i am currently working weird hours trying to get the 1b of debt closed and funded   i will get back to you

name
 

maybe overkill i would rather send them an email talking about the problems and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating   i am little touchy right now about how to approach people so we need to be careful   i am open to more discussion on this just would like to soften the tone a litlle
 

i am not sure i just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of
 

please send tomy direct reports

while i am out of the officetoday please keep name name up to speed on what you see and hear  he is leading the effort in our areas during this time of stresscrisis for me
 

if i needed to change the account that bills were to be paid into for this necxt billing cycle can it be done for tw and nng
 

since we are no longer using maverix that guarantee can be done away with    are the rest all really with name    in the underlying deals do we have any ability to ask for better than a guarantee if enron is downgraded
 

i am assuming that by now you know that i am pledging my receivables into the secured deal name boyle is working on
 

they took bids and i think have an offer of about 60 mm or so

name what do you know about this one
 

the data is actually aggregated and netted the specific deal data is not provided   the detail he described might be the aggregate of 40 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals   see the bolded data below   the example given basically says i am in a position of having more gas at ventura in january 2002
than i have commitments to sell by 10 mmcfd     did you understand that
 

name called back and explained    we need to do 100 and begin to look at dollars that could be saved    this is an estimating process to figure out if we can effectively reduce our spending and by how much and then what portion of that benefits name
 

we will get it handled     can you send out the notice that the dates are changing and we will have to reschedule before you leave
 

i think that we are already well underway on tws red rock and were not expexting to use external capital for  no other major projects underway that are impacted by enrons situation
 

i have asked corporate where it will be reported in the 4th qtr if its not going to be reported as wholesale then there is no real reason to bother name
 

to the best of my knowledge there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c

drew can you think of anything we may have done while you were in omaha that might fit this request
 

i have forwarded to name and agree with your perspective    could you begin to think about who those people might be if we decided to do something
 

the following representations among others have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement with the banks and the preferred stock agreement dynegy to the boards of transwestern tw northern nng and name transportation services etsc and it subsidiaries as well as to dynegy and the banks

the funds that are being loaned out of nng and tw to various entities and the further loans of these funds to name will carry name corp guaranties
the note agreements will reimburse nng tw and etsc and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors
the credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arms length standard needs to be applied to dealings between etsc and its subsidiaries and name and the rest of its subsidiaries

before the funding under the credit agreement takes place i would like to make sure that you two are aware of this have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between name and etsc and its subs to make the above representations not be false

here are my edits to the faq document  sorry but i dont understand the pool allocation response  

 

my notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions
 where storage allocation notices appear 
 why storage allocation notices come out at a later time

fixes already put in place
in the followup letter we categorize the feedback  cant we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items

 make customers aware that they can call hottap helpdesk for calls
 raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings
 namet we taken a step to notify edi customers about system downtime
 we have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages
 arent we adding an injectionwithdrawal indicators
 cant we immediately change the confusing descriptors storage analysis completed vs storage allocations completed  see my suggestion in faq

name

im not sure if we met either time at the name airport this summer  my husband and i hosted 4year old name part of the same taraz group as your child   we miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home  were certainly not looking forward to travel at this time and even less happy about leaving our 6year old son home while we are out of country but we are resolved to bring name home  the sooner the better

based on conversations with name and name it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time  although im not sure when

we have completed our dossier although i havent sent the originals to name completed our home study  sent into ins recently and weve already done the ins fingerprinting  so i guess the next steps are ins approval shipping stuff off to kazakstan and getting our kazakstan visas

one of the hardest parts of the kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return  she is in the ulan orphanage in taraz  name speaks only kazak no russian so im not sure how id communicate with her long distance even if i had an address or phone number  fortunately i have received periodic emails from name the escort that came to name with the children this summer  her husband sergei has been to visit the children in taraz  she sent me a picture of name

sorry to ramble so  im anxious to talk to you about your child your travel plans possibilities for hiring an escort etc  please feel free to call or email me anytime  here is my contact info

are you interested in getting a group of people together to buy 4 tickets est cost 10000  would need to be split 10 ways to be doable
 

im thinking that we may miss church altogether on sunday  we may spend the night at my inlaws in conroe  they have been bugging us to visit and i dont see another date on the calendar that will work  nov 3 for example there is no childrens church but i am openclose trustee  namet worry about the cd player  its no problem  i dont mind exchanging it until we get a cd player and duplicate copies of music which im working on
 
we received our ins approval to adopt name but with court date delays etc it looks like our most likely travel time is late november or early december  when i get a little better info  i will make childrens church plans  if it turns out that im gone several weeks in december then perhaps we can talk name into letting the kids sit in regular church during advent  it is always such a fun time for them to be in church  they recognize so many of the songs  if im only going to be gone in late dec  first week of dec then we can probably continue with childrens church as planned  im really just guessing now  since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute
 

oops my mistake  ive lost track of my dates  was thinking that winefest was several weeks off  its next week
 

i know you are swamped with other matters so i jotted down in memo form my travel plans  i guess its names law that i got the phone call that i need to travel now in the midst of current work events

i never heard back from you after i sent the fax yesterday  i am anxious about correctly signing and notarizing the ins forms and would like to discuss when you have a minute
 

name

i was about to send off the info from the prior email when i received your latest update  however im confused by the update  the form seems to be the same except it is intended to be sent to the republic of kazakhstan in new york  is that really where we are sending our registration information  what about the autobiography  what is that what is required  

i understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today  but frankly this whole process was a surprise to me  does your agency have an written materials on followup requirementsprocesses in general  im sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next  when to apply for ss  what about readoption  passport certificate of citizenship etc  i was surprised when a resident alien card arrived

i need to take care of the registration issue today as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week
 

name

fyi  the statements about transco not honoring eol contracts doesnt make sense to me  i dont understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations
 

okay sounds like we are the first taraz group and the almaty group is before us  that is the group that she said is not traveling until nov 15  sergei is the guide to both the almaty group and to us    

i am so much praying that we will be home before dec 15 on that date my nanny returns to bolivia for christmas and i will be lacking childcare for name at home  wow this waiting is stressful

based on current est travel times i think that we will both travel over  name will probably be the one to stay the two weeks so that i can come home to tend to name  his obligations   we definitely dont want to leave name to come with an escort  but the issue we still need to work through is the fact that name is still scared o name
 

hi  im here  just barely though  my sinus infection is back  can we get together in my office the less elevator riding the better sometime between 111  im planning to be out of office tomorrow

ive had a change in my schedule today and i wont drop off the check in person  i deposited the name check in my bank account this am on my way to work to make sure i get the cash before any bankruptcy filing and will have a personal check couriered over to your office

unless you instruct otherwise i will make the check out to salomon smith name and put the caption fbo name corman in the memo line of check  let me know if an account number should appear on the check

name
 

i know you were being nice and i am sorry

i really cant put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now  it takes me 12 hour to get myself together  

i shouldnt have been so mean to you  i know you were being nice  i know this isnt a reasonable request but these arent reasonable times  i just need some space when im getting ready in the morning  

the heat and the fact that i couldnt have coffee this morning just put me over the edge

my physical was ok  listen to this because they are a preventive medicine shop he cant prescribe antibiotics  so then i couldnt get my travel vaccines until i find out whether i have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics 

am i just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life
 

name

just a heads up  pending pipeline board rep approval name asked that i prepare the attached letter for name somerhalder to send to the gisb office if this is appropriate form
 

ill try to attend this meeting if you need me  i have a cle class out of the office from 122 today  but i would like to dispel the suggestion that jerry put together the spreadsheet for me  im very enthusiastic about the ar tools that jerry  name have developed and im happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks but i feel like i made it clear that the customer service reps like marion that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of jerrys reports   if the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs  then it should be modified  im all for automation and less manual intervention
 

can they come in the afternoon on feb 18 presidents day  i have an appointment with the tax lady in the am

can you see about getting name a dentist appointment on mar 1 at 8 am  or at 1 pm   is it time for name to have an appointment again  name has off school on mar 1  i plan to take a vacation day  name has an appointment for more vaccinations with dr kline at 10 am  we may go to the zoo after that
 

yes  i volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year  i was planning to pick up some flowers early sat morning at plant at the church  if you want to meet me there around 830 am or so that would be great but please dont feel obligated  i think we could get the planting done in about an hour

congrats to you on your recent wedding  i am so thrilled for you both
 

i am feeling pretty blue today with all the name stuff  finances being what they are  we need to do some serious soul searching on name oaks  can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck  please also calculate the value of your transocean options  i may want to monetize these to cover adoptiontravel expenses
 

thanks for your leadership on this issue  the commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and i havent made much headway with the gms folks  im glad you are involved

i will be traveling out of the country next week  others from my staff will attend and ill catch up when i return

happy holidays
name
 

thank you for your thoughts  i am fine   our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally  while these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many name employees that lost their jobs today we have not had any workforce reductions in our area  its a little lonely in the building and i have to make sure to put my lipstick on before i go down to the lobby to face all the tv cameras camped out down there
 

thanks for talking to ange  ill give her a call tonight

my preference is for me to take 317 you to take 324 ill have company and no childrens church on name  let me know what you think

name
 
do you know how to get in touch with name name or name fancler over the weekend
i have most of the gas logistics related items prepared for tw for the bankruptcy lawyers  including contract lists and receivables  i need to have someone run a payables list
 
i can be reach via blackberry or on cell 7138572103
 

when i asked you to adjust the gas logistics paas to 100 i forgot to ask you to do the same on the separate paa for gift checks for eott pipeline control  please give me a call if you need any supplemental paperwork from me

happy holidays
 

i was afraid shed think i was being difficult if i mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe not to mention my concerns about missing names christmas events in december and our nanny holiday issue
my gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to kazakhstan  because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasnt been turned in sufficient time
 

thanks  nonotice imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing  the only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cashout price
 

here is my draft written review  take a look at it and well sit down when you have a chance

keep up the great work  i know things have been really stressful for you lately  it was terrific to have you to rely on when i was away and when im here too
 

sounds interesting although i dont have capital dollars at this point for modifications to make cas accessible to customers   let me touch base with my team to talk about this concept  ill get back with you
 

i think we expected it  the alj said he need more time for his decision  on a positive note it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement
 

i know that we are all under a lot of stress and i probably shouldnt send this note but i just have to get this off my chest  have i done something to undermine your faith in me  

 when i worked on due diligence matters you asked me why was i working on due diligence
 when i prepared the demand letters you asked me why i was sending the demand letters
 and today despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions there is no mention of my group in the customer letter

i wish someone would just fire me if im incompetent because i live in a hell worse than being fired  at least id have time for my family
 

name is having a 12 day staff meeting next wed  dec 12 until lunchtime   accordingly i need to reschedule my staff meeting

sorry but i dont have an isolated power plant capex number 

in the nng commercial folks original budget they forcasted 12 m revenue growth from 25 million 2002 capital  so my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital  depreciation then 25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth
 

yes  please add name head name bakanic  name name syckle if its not too many

the offer is still open for you and name to host at my house if you would like

here is gabys address

name name  name

i have samples of groups vbs curriculum and childrens church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think

groups vbs this year is called bug safari think bugs life  the bible lessons are about name and play on theme of little in size big in spirit  the video that can be used during refreshment time  is the basis of our friday evening program features chatter the chipmunk  so we could reuse the adorable costume name turney made  i would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon which i would like to do in late feb or early march   i would also like to agree on the date in midlate july for vbs  i think i currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar

i also have ordered samples of groups childrens church curriculum  i have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some preprepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers  most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping  but not preparing  a childrens church worship  

evening meetings are difficult for me right now  as there is much to do in the evenings and little time  i would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available  name will be out of the country the first few weekends in feb or i can meet on fri feb 1 or fri feb 8   if either of those days suit
 

hi name

i have name at the dr for her physical this afternoon but we should be home by 6 pm and be home all evening  sorry i missed choir last night   we are still transitioning and name had a fit as we were leaving a friends house to come to choir  

see you soon
name
 

name  right after i had name run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight name called me to say that the application will probably need the sworn and subscribed language before the notary stamp   

do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp  or perhaps feed it through your computer printer  i sent three signed and notarized copies  so you have a few extras to play with



here is the missing language


state of texas  
county of harris

sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of november 2001



my conversation with name was quite different than my conversation with name  while she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares  she also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around dec 17 might be possible if one didnt mind being away at nametmas

on my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in astana  when i called her back she said that this was a mistake  that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in astana on thurs or fri


you can call me at home tonight if you want to talk
 

both names parents  my mom will be at the house on christmas evechristmas day  so i think theyll eat their christmas meal at our house  im sure that name name mom and nevin would appreciate a christmas evening dessert invite  you can coordinate when you see them for mexican food on sat night

first worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 93001 total transport revenue is 1806 million  other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates  this information has been furnished to name name  the only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials  i spoke with tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for tw for this period of 200 m  the difference is primarily fuel sales which are not currently included in my numbers
 

i just listened to the presentation on the gisb final rule on intraday recalls

the final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases

1 by may 2002 pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective july 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper

2 with respect to recalls during the flowing gas day the commission directs naesb gisb to file comments by october 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated with reply comments by october 15

commissioner massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability  staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable  the releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not  

the discussion of the order seems to be in step with ets pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity releaserecall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day  the fact that comments arent even being filed on phase 2 until oct   i think were safe to assume that this phase wont be implemented until 2003
 

name
 
i would like to see the following notations added to the gas logistics capex page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement
 
with respect to the specific project listed
 
1  gas logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 discretionary projects including the three gas control networksecurity upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project 19000 omitted from your listing  no further written proposal is required by dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects
 
 
with respect to footnote 2  i believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion
 
2  dynegy requested and name agreed that nng will not be charged any additional amounts for the base contract system through june 30 2002 unless dynegy authorizes name to begin work on the customization and implementation of the nng contract system prior to june 30 2002   to the extent that name is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for nng prior to june 30 2002 it is understood that the implementation date of the nng contract system will be impacted
 
3  dynegy requested and name agreed that nng will not be charged any additional amounts for the base rates and revenue system through june 30 2002  
 
 
an additional footnote should be added to the page
 
4    the 2002 capital budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement nngs order 637 filingrevised filing provisions or gisb changes   dynegy and name will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected ferc requirements
 

sorry i missed you today

looking forward to lunch tomorrow  name 1145 at la grilia suit you

have fun at your event tonight

also  mea culpa  i just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that i missed names birthday  i hope that wasnt the day we were all over at your house  oops  wish name a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion

see you tomorrow
 

i dont understand why the schedule show no variance for gas logistics  my workpapers indicate that we should be down by 300k or so
 

name

namet heard from you in awhile and i am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity  all of my paperwork including ins approval is turned into name and i am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to kazakhstan  name and crew are so busy that i imagine that things wont happen very fast  

not try to bother you if you had enough of this kidsave stuff  but on the other hand  you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and i just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts

name
 

name

i spoke with name today to tell her that my notarized ins approval is in the mail  she said she is really busy because name is on vacation  she reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to almaty before us  they are not traveling until nov 15  we will be after that  perhaps a week or 10 days later   

this journey is certainly full of ups and downs  i was thrilled to receive ins approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late november or early december  

i was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the almaty group  what do you think  perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for oksana

can you send me the latest version

hi ms traylor

i gave my mom a heads up that flat name would be arriving in the mail soon  but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play  before poor name is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether master name might be in a brown envelope  i didnt have ms jungs
email

name all is well with you  i am so pleased with how happy name is with school  at first he expected to be 
coddled like kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard  boy how things have changed in a month
yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard  kindergarten was soooooo boring

i really appreciate the firm yet compassionate manner you have with the kids  it is just what name needs to develop

while im writing i will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school  over the summer we hosted
a 4year old orphan girl name from kazakhstan  she had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her  the other day name was watching tv and saw a picture of some afghan children  he commented how much they look
like name and then burst out in tears  if the school works on a project for the afghan kids name may seem a little more emotional than usual  just wanted you to know

it has been terrific to correspond with name  satisfying to help her get info on oksana from my correspondence with larisa  my dossier is with name hopefully being translated  i have not yet received my ins approval and im scared that ill anger them if i start calling
 

heres my first stab


key findings
1 with only one significant exception the groups acknowledge their tasksresponsibilities in the measurement process  the only area that appears to be lacking defined rolesresponsibility is followthrough on open issuescorrections that are not made prior to close
2  the main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication followthrough
3  there needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the nng billing process  current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating uaf
4  the customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing


name

1 educate field and gms staff on use of measurement data in billing  combination of written materials and presentations  gas logistics
2 renegotiate chart changing agreementsgain understanding of timing parameters
3 assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close
4 develop single point of organizational accountability for qualitytimeliness of data fed into pgas including field teams with respect to their measurement duties measurement technology gms and uaf specialist
 

just got off the phone with name and i know you already talked to her 

my direct flight tomorrow cleared so i plan on taking it  i will pray really hard that you can join me on the 20th  then we can spend some of our waiting time together

i have received the revised w2 forms from name that increases my reported income to reflect my noneligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts  see letter in the package of information that i previously delivered to you  evidently name failed the test for providing dependent day care benefits to highly compensated employees  i will fedex the revised w2 forms to you

i would like to set up a date perhaps over the lunch hour one day to meet at your office to review my return and to discuss alternatives for the second home either rental or sale to my mother andor her fianc
 

i worked on the grade level promtion  i didnt know what her new title was supposed to be name chcecked with name and she told her coordinator  so i guess well have to check back in with name
 

skyline refers to added seasonality that nng proposed to add to its rates  the rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak  so no we didnt implement skyline as proposed and nothing is pending  i expect that nng will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case
 

she has absolutely everything  a gift isnt necessary  im working on family pictures for her  so a recent one of you guys would be great  and if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story

call me anytime for info  ill let you know the next time ill be in dc and you are always welcome to hop on down to name for a weekend  tracey is coming next weekend  well be in state college around july 4

keep me posted
 

here is my two cents

from your message i understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches 
overhang the condominium fence  if so then the tree belongs to ashford  

the condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line but may not go on
our property or destroy the tree  

a landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is
obstructing a public road   a landowner cant be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something  since
the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety there doesnt appear to be a negligence issue
further a landowner isnt negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm 
unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm  

if the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree they would have to do so on a nuisance theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property  still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous

bottom line  we dont have a responsibility to trim the tree but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues dont ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down
 

please verify that this is taken care of and that i do not need to have someone in my group work on this  thanks

id tell her that we have actual tickets for games on mar 9 astros and mar 13 indians but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game  we just pulled schedules from the web

my feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to fl you should say that i rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days  i know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us  but im afraid the kids will spill the beans
 

thanks for your kind words  i also wanted to thank you for your flexibility in covering both the gas control desks and the measurement desk

i need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before i leave town on thursday  i was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on eronline my wallet was stolen over the weekend and i had to change bank accounts  i was also able to adjust my efcu deductions

i am unable to complete the following changes online and im hoping that you can help me work these issues
 stop pac contributions
 stop savings bond automatic purchases
 stop 2002 united way deduct  i had selected to make one time contribution in feb around bonus time  my plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the united way bill me directly instead

thanks in advance for your help
 

when i called names house today to see if she received my ins approval one of her children answered and said that she is at name house  so i guess that means name has returned  if your process estimates are in line our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of november date  i am very concerned that we will slip to nametmas time travel

while im not trying to have you do my dirty work i feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at name or name this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in  after all your paperwork has been turned in for some time  you have specific health concerns for oksana  since i just turned in my ins approval even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks i feel like i dont have much standing to complain about timing
 

okay ive already had questions about statements in this memo  my understanding of this is as follows  in the event of bankruptcy employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of 4650 if the company were to file next week this amount should be small since payday was today  in addition employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at 4650
 

i already had name prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations  it is rough still  but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe
 

its been canceled  there were no unauthorized withdrawals  it very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home but i didnt want to take any chances  its inactivated  ill have to go to the local branch if i want a new atm card with nondebit features  the automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features
 

sorry im so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion  nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy  before i left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers  per names note below the bankruptcy court hasnt acted on it yet  ill let you know if i hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers

did ets officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment  any computers or just flat screens

hi name  name

name you are doing well  just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my ins approval

when i spoke with name a few days ago she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the almaty group probably in late november  

after i get off the phone i always think of  questions i should have asked  since my questions are not critical but process in nature i thought id drop an email  
i am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel  how long does translation take  what happens after that  when is the dossier sent to kazakstan  typically how much notice are people given of their kazak court date

i would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the christmas holiday  as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in name 

sorry for so many questions  i know that you are both very busy and i know that patience is definitely in order with this process  i am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that i am realistic about the steps involved

the ferc is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules but ill answer in the context of the current rules

there are three main principles behind the current rules
1 pipeline cant share shipper information with affiliate
2 pipeline cant share transportation info with affiliate  unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info and
3 pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible

there is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately  for example pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate  wed argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better  but compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations  price terms etc  the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business  there was a real case to this effect  the pipeline  affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning  the pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting  ferc found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline

so id say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to researchtraininghistorical type info but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions

corp security did a quick audit today of the gas control center on eb42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week  

1 tighten control of access to the gas control facilities
	 they recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so
	 they recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only

	we have arranged for a guard beginning monday morning access to gas control will be through the south
	hallway and door only exit except for emergencies will be limited to the south door as well the guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry 

	we have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except gas logistics and
	it support staff we have disabled access into gas control on all doors except the	south door

	we have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the gas control presentation
	center eb42c1 

2 isolate the gas control network environment  disconnect our network from the corporate backbone 
	
	we do not intend to isolate gas control until events dictate that we should we are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate while minimizing the impact to the gas control scada system the tms system and pgas 
	
on monday we will also configure the hangar to support temporary operation of the gas control and other gas logistics
business functions two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones network connections 
and workstations they will be configured to support up to 60 staff the minimum staffing requirements for the hangar to
support the gas control and gas logistics functionsas currently defined is 35 staff the hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks depending on events
 

sorry i missed your call last night  i had a good cry and went to bed early  
 
as you noted in your voice message i am planning to travel by myself on saturday dec 15  it is the only time i can get a confirmed flight albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive  
 
here is the other part of my plans  i feel fairly sure that i will return to the us immediately after my court date unless the stay requirements are very very short  i can fathom the courage to travel by myself but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself  also all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me
 
i am still planning to have connie move forward with getting name a letter of invitation visas  including a russian visa that is good until midjanuary  that way name can return for name after the first of the year if necessary  please ask sergei to look into possible arrangements  i would be happy to pay for sergei and larisa to have a holiday in moscow if they were willing to fly with name there  perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to almaty  
 
i am totally terrified about traveling by myself   but this isnt a fear that will ease with time  i feel like i just have to dive in or i am going to change my mind
 
i need some reassurance on what happens at the airport  name the assistance service help me at customs  name sergei pick me up and where will i find him  do i have hotel accomodations if so preferrably at the hyatt
 
obviously i am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without name  i wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why i am leaning towards leaving on sat

schedulers talking points on the separation of nngena


 

1  nng and ena are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another

2  customers may think that they can net ena invoices against nng invoices  nng is a separate business and is not responsible for ena invoices to their customers

3  should suppliers cut volumes for ena nng will cut the market accordingly

4  creditworthiness status for ena remains the responsibility of the commercial department we are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise

with heightened security concern in the building this morning i wanted to report two items

1 when i parked in the name center garage this morning level 7 yellow section at the top of the stairs from the name building just under the covered area i noticed a large browncopper truck  i park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and i have never seen this truck before  its probably nothing just wanted to report it

2 when i reached my desk this morning i wanted to call in this concern  i pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 7134352804  the woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasnt corporate security but rather building security  she laughed and didnt seem remotely interested in my concern  perhaps i misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns  but if i did perhaps other employees will as well
 

name

except for this week it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42c1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control
 

how did you make sure it was the right set  name it be delivered

im so excited  this will make my week

we will be out of town on sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing  we will be at choir practice sunday evening

ill look for march and april songs for the cherubs

the videotape of the christmas program is cute  maybe we can find a time to watch it
 

im concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that weve built up again  name  are these numbers verified and up to date  can i get a breakdown of the 15 bcf and the 700 mmcf current month portion   it seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now were building these balances back up again  

if these supply imbalances are building up as a result of phase v outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project

 i need to reconcile the net volume on names sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on names sheet  there are huge differences  can these really all be receipt imbalances

name for the months aug 00jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances   we are only planning to put the majorityminority pricing on the market area imbalances

1  we can include the sithe agreement in the master netting agreement although we do not believe that this will work for dynegy as it is not a forward contract but an annuity stream which cannot be accelerated however if they think it works  fine  we would not want the margin calculated net it needs to be exclusive of this transaction  if they were to convert to two swaps in order to allow for acceleration in the master netting agreement there is an accounting issue for us

2  in the east we are long physical power from them in the markets which are not pools  we are short to them in the pools which clear financially and we have no issues in the pools  so we do not need to do anything  ill have the west soon 

3  we will have our physical gas position by point soon  we will agree to prepay for all of dec but we should only pay day by day

those are funny  work is hectic cant write much but hope to find a time that you can come visit

we will be running a december mtd dpr tomorrow  before we start this process please recalc the east west eastbank  westbank portfolios to adhoc  check one more time that only terminated counterparties are in the bank portfolios and all terminated counterparties are out of the east and west portfolios

before kicking off the calcs double check the specific deals that are listed on the physical power terminated spreadsheet  i believe there were whole deals moved to the bank portfolios by name that should never have been moved because they were already liquidated in november  also i have attached a new copy of the physical terminations  there is one counterparty txu added to the list that we need to take care of before kicking off the calcs  in addition to adjusting deal entry for txu we also need to adjust scheduling

before recalcing the bank portfolios please contact name brackett or name mcginnis 42022 to make sure that they have extracted the data they need from the portfolios

we should still be calcing on no trueup  casey i know you said this probably will still cause us trouble  at this point we are going for reasonableness with numbers  all the previous toplevels in our rolls as of the 3rd or 4th will stay as toplevels until we know the exact amount of cash that is being attributed to power  the remaining prior day values will be held in schedule e for georgeanne to move to a balance sheet account  these top levels should match the total value of your bankruptcy portfolios  where i think it will get tricky is that we are calculating as of the 18th and have transactions in the bankruptcy portfolio that are before the 18th and therefore will fall into your liquidations  these numbers will also have to moved to schedule e

when running through liquidations in the east and west portfolios we will not be flat  currently we are liquidating all nonterminated counterparties other than those specifically negotiated out of by scheduling  thresa and i are working on this with corry and name  the settlements group will figure out what the counterparty agrees with through the checkout and ultimately the cleanup process

tomorrow should be a blast  i cant wait

can you please autoschedule the following deals for december  please let name and i know when you are complete

name

deal 
114998
578961
578964
578965
 

after talking to name i have a new plan of attack for schedule es  he informed me that the toplevels were typically put in at one region level per roll  i had zhiyun rerun the killed deals calc post id 15667  everyone should go back into the rolls and put the toplevels into their correct regions also adjusting the schedule es  this is why the differences are so large in certain areas and the only way we can start to pinpoint the problem is to find the problem spots

i have also identified where the 46 mm difference for oppd arose from  deal  1167804 has not been transferred into the east bank book  in addition there are no volumes in this deals however if you look back to the official 11302001 calc there are volumes for this deal  it gets more bizarre than that because there were two deals that should have been transferred for oppd 116784 and 5648261  deal 5648261 was transferred but the valuations are approximately 4mm different  i have printed detail for deals 116784 and 5648261 they are in caseys chair as of the 11302001 official calc  i have also printed deal 5648261 in the 11302001 bankruptcy calc  i noticed that i cannot see any swap detail reports for the bankruptcy calc  please recalc and generate these reports as they will probably be important as we dig into details

other than name who has to perform some it testing no one should be working or playing on anything other than trying to get these schedule es and toplevels figured out  the task is actually very important as there will be many decisions made off of these numbers

thanks

the blending vs nonblending can be confusing and could potentially cause problems down the road so i would first like to make some general statements regarding the history or this change and what the rules should be as i understand them  

	only the curves applicable to the east nerc regions are being marked as a daily and monthly volatility therefore no blending is needed for daily options they point directly to the daily vols or monthly options they point directly to the monthly vol  all curves applicable to the west nerc regions are still being marked as intramonth and monthly therefore blending is needed to provide a volatility for daily options

	the best rules to be in place for the blending vs nonblending would be based on curve  east curves do not blend  west curves do blend  therefore any daily or monthly option in the east would not have to blend  the potential problem that could be caused by making the rule apply to portfolios is that for example the east portfolio could potentially enter into an option at a west region curve and that transaction would need to use blended curves even though it is in the east portfolio

	options at a different expiry than daily or monthly is another problem  are there different blending rules embedded in the code for weekly expiration  we still need to discuss this

	i would be happy to all sit down and have a meeting concerning this issue whenever everyone is comfortable enough that we know all the current rules  let me know

here are the procedures for the east  the west is not currently running option sensitivities 

approximately every one to two weeks or as requested by the options traders an option sensitivity report is run using portcalc  three parameters are tested  price increments from 5 to 5 monthly volatility increments from 25 to 25 and time increments up to 90 days  reminder  the increments are changeable  the data is imported from portcalc into an excel pivot table  the pivot table is then used to show how the various greeks delta gamma theta and vega change for each traders book generally with a 3 month look ahead  the data can also be sorted by and grouped by other criteria if requested such as by region and delivery date these reports are given to the east option traders only

each of you needs to send a book request for the east  west portfolios for the counterparties listed in the following spreadsheet  the spreadsheet identifies those counterparties which we are still performing under the contracts  please create a eastperformance and a westperformance book  we then need to get all deals with the following counterparties moved to those books  i would suggest you pull the values out of adhoc as of 1231 for the counterparties by desk before transferring them to the new desk  obviously these transactions will create prior days and the amount will run through the pl in the old and new books and flatten out  the remaining prior day value will need to be in schedule e

this spreadsheet is an attempt to outline supply  demand in san name by unit  next i want to look at the numbers by bedroom  lets compare numbers

here is a list of questions

1	unit mixes of all proposed projects
2	completion date of  blazer development 220 capstone 270 melrose 202 bonnercarr 186
3	is the capstone 270 units or 270 beds


 
this spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 20032005  san name will have over 6000 units  if the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5  that would not be a disaster

tomorrow i would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data

i finally got in touch with the department that handles stock options  unfortunately they are committed to paine webber for the foreseeable future  the two primary reasons they gave for not wanting to explore a new relationship were an exclusive contract with paine webber and the reporting and tax interfaces that are already in place  they are less concerned with the services that paine webber doesnt offer the employees such as lending against vested options

sector 2 plan geets boost from council  by murlin evans  staff reporter  home and landowners in northwestern san name will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area  the san name city council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its sector two land use plan  changes over a year in the making and covering a 126 square mile area  intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region  significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident name weatherford at the corner of ranch road 12 and the newly named craddock avenue bishop street  weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve rezoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current sector two plan  proposed changes to weatherfords 54 acre tract  which have no direct effect on existing zoning  deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial one additional acre of medium density residential and seven additional acres of low density residential  in addition the total eight acres of the weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home singlefamily or multifamily senior housing development in the revised future land use plan  the total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to community commercial  a yet to be established zoning district  loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping  a 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan  however a curb cut envisioned to access this property from rr 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway  proposed are two curb cuts one accessing the proposed weatherford commercial area from rr 12 and one from craddock avenue  while the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go city planning director name patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and weatherford  council member name hughson supported the idea of removing the rr 12 curb cut allowance from the sector plan but evaluating a developers plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds  id rather say no and if someone comes us with a really good idea look at it then hughson said  councilman name mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut  it seems to me were asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there mihalkanin said  a motion by hughson to amend the plan to exclude curb cuts from rr 12 into the property failed on a 33 tie vote with san name mayor name chiu and council members joe cox and name mayhew voting against the move council member name castex name was not present at the meeting  curb cuts or not the sector two plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives who said the plan was a good compromise  oak heights resident name mcbride who has been an active critic and participant in the sector two revision process especially concerning the weatherford tract said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole  this is not a victory for one side or the other said mcbride alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to weatherfords initial plans for his property but a victory for the city of san name we started out with all r1weve come a long way

managing var limits is essential and pl penalties are a great way to achieve this  however we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as 1 discouraging aggressive trading and 2 significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime

i still disagree with the 1 million fine for such a minor violation of our var limit  the punishment does not fit the crime what message are you trying to send  the message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times  also locations such as socal malin and pge should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes  i know these are not your intended messages  

i realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding var  we have been making excellent progress towards var reduction in an environment in which the var calculation and tolerance are constantly changing   my suggestion for implementing a var control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum var utilization is a warning for minor breaches 500000 and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than 500000  the amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation

please consider these suggestions  we want to play by the rules but the rules need to be fair and known in advance  also we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the 1 million from this morning

the release that name prepared provides for the payback of any utilities that i have been paying since 420  you might mention to them that we need to get the utilities settled up before we pay the 11000  it might be a good idea to go ahead and have the utilities transferred so we can get the final amount since 420

also may 20th was supposed to be the 1st payment on the two notes  but i have not received payment on either

lets try and wrap this up this week

i plugged the data on colonial oaks into your format  the actual noi for 2001 is around 305000  but there is not a professional management company  subtracting 25000 for management costs the noi would be 280000  however i increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to 3000unit  this would yield an noi of 240000  comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties it doesnt look like the rents have a great deal of upside  

the asking price is 2700000  using 240000 would make this an 89 cap  using the sellers noi of 280000 would be a 104 cap  the cost per unit is 33750 for a 1969 project  the cost per square foot is 3658  

the numbers would be better if the property was offered at 25 million  name smith claims that 27 million is as low as the seller will go  this property has not been on the market  so i would like your input of what the market would pay for it  if 280000 is a reasonable noi then i would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for 27 million  it does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants  plus the location is by far the most convenient

financing is the other consideration  i am assuming 25 year 7  and 25 down  what do you think could actually be achieved  can you put me in contact with a lender

i will follow up with a phone call

for clarity wherever you cite section 62 in your response i assume you mean section 63  

your response does not address the key points upon which i based my interpretation of the plan  the beginning of section 63 states notwithstanding any other provision of the plan   this implies that section 63 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution  i disagree with your translation of a single sum distribution as meaning all at once instead of a single amount  i would like to meet to discuss or appeal to name w or name l   in addition your response does not address section 71  this appears to be the relevant section if the psa is to be paid in shares  additionally the q  a section in the plan brochure pg 8 works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value  this is the methodology described in section 71

two items

1  i spoke to name mckay about sumas  his views seem well thought out  he is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200000day of supply coming back by july 1st  see attached spreadsheet  in order to displace aeco gas coming down to kingsgate his target for sumas value is aeco 010  but since his forecast for aeco is that they will have 30 bcf left in storage at the end of march and current cash is trading down 070 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 050 he is expecting the aeco curve to widen to down 085  therefore his ultimate target for sumas is down 095 versus the current market of down 040
	his winter sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand see attached spreadsheet  sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers dont  support that premium
	in conclusion i think i will sell some more summer sumas for my book

thank you for meeting with me on friday  i left feeling very optimistic about the panel system  i would like to find a way to incorporate the panels into the home design i showed you  in order to make it feasible within my budget i am sure it will take several iterations  the prospect of purchasing the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered  however my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor

i realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this product with very little probability of a sale  i just want to assure you that i am going to build this house in the fall and i would seriously consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in cost over stick built

is the problem that the energy dwr purchased is above market and not needed by core  or  just above market  if the energy is needed by core wouldnt the deals just be blended in as costs like utility gen and qf supply  if the energy is not needed now could the state sell back the excess then compute the exact loss and put a surcharge on rates for all or some customers that recoup that amount over time  once again there would be a ctc type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered

i checked with wink and his prices were slightly lower per square foot but the builder was not keen on the panels wink is selling because the dimensional lumber to frame windows and doors is not included  so that reduces some of the savings  either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to 20000 more for a 4000 sq ft home  even if i assume my energy savings will be 125month it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5 interest rate  

cost is a major concern but i am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs  i am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do  what are some other alternatives that would also be effective  radiant barrier  more attic ventilation  

thank you for your help

happy holidays  

 

 

dear tech support

last year i upgraded from boyfriend 50 to husband 10 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under boyfriend 50 in addition husband 10
uninstalled many other valuable programs such as romance 99and installed
undesirable programs such as nfl 50 and nba 30

conversation 80 no longer runs and housecleaning 26 simply crashes
the system ive tried running nagging 53 to fix these problems but to
no avail what can i do

name

 

dear desperate

first keep in mind that boyfriend 50 is an entertainment package
while husband 10 is an operating system install tears 62 and enter the
command c i thought you loved me

husband 10 should then automatically run the applications guilty 30 and
flowers 70 but remember overuse can cause husband 10 to default to
grumpy silence 25 happy hour 70 or beer 61 beer 61 is a very bad
program that will create snoring loudlywav files

do not install motherin law 10 or reinstall another boyfriend
program these are not supported applications and will crash husband 10

in summary husband 10 is a great program but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly you might consider
buying additional software to improve performance i personally recommend
hot food 30 and lingerie 69

good luck
 

grand romance package

its the ultimate in romance starting at 1827 for four nights ideal for honeymooners or couples on a romantic getaway this package includes

name

attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10year term gas 9200182011 delivered per your proposed project with national fuel

the bid as of tuesdays closing prices comes to 463mmbtu with the following assumptions

1  per goeff storey the basis spread is zero from the mid using the cgprniagara curve

2  national fuel will deliver the gas on the nfg system at niagara  the desired point per storey would be on tcplniagara system on the canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport    it is possible that it could be negotiated with nfg to deliver the gas on the tcplniagara system

3 nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this small size

let me know if you have any further questions


thanks

the following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the fort name project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by name fairley name mcmichael name concannon name breese name boyt and name name   note  the heat rates and mw are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation  the intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions

1 during the summertime months of may through september the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  names 200 mw are dispatched as are ft names 82mw

2  name will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 mw for 16 hours per day at our boughtdown heat rate of 6690  this equals 22300 mmbtuday and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period 6 per hour  the table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements



   month	total capacity needed by name	ft name capacity from fgu	phase vi capacity 	capacity from east desk	
may	22300	0	22300	0	
june	22300	0	22300	0	
july	22300	0	22300	0	
august	22300	0	22300	0	
september	22300	0	22300	0	


  ntoe  prior to phase vi completion the project will purchase capacity from the east desk

3  ft name will use its existing ft via fgu to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer

4  for the winter months of october through april the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where ft name is not dispatched thus leaving name with 282mw at the overall plant heat rate of 7500  this equates to 35251 mmbtuday and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours 6 per hour

5  because ft name will not be dispatched during the winter their unused capacity via fgu will be available for name  these amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below

6 name will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 mw for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate less the monthly capacities available from ft name via fgu  these nonfgu purchased quantities will come from the phase vi capacity and the east desk as shown below

please provide the admission committee with a brief narrative overview of your admissionvisit dialogue you may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings

name is definitely a good match for the texas mba program  she is a high energy very resultsoriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments  her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and i see no issue that would prevent her from being a topnotch mba student at ut

as i previously shared the result for vandium in the lowsulfer diesel 2 fuel oil came back at 01 ppm versus the spec of 005 ppm  i just talked to the lab supervisor at saybolt whom performed the analysis and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within onetenth of a ppm  

the only way he knows of is to use a nmr nuclear magnetic resonance machine that nasa uses to analyze rocket fuel  he is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that if they did allow it could cost upwards of 10000 

please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further

team

we now have the capability of importing live eol quotes into our models if so desired  name tonks who supports it development efforts for the trading floor has made this capability available to us via a file that i have now saved in the models directory under the name eolproductlisten

in order to run the file you will first need to run a program called tibco rendezvous client  you can run this program by going to the start menusystem utility applicationsinstallation and disk creationinstall tibco rendezvous client  you will have to reboot after installation is complete  after rebooting you can then open the program eol program listen

the program has 2 sheets 1 eol and 2 eolsearch

sheet 1 eol is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an eol id number that you enter in column c in order to determine the correct eol id number you need to use sheet 2 eolsearch  on this sheet you can enter a search string in cell b1 and then hit the search macro  efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number  once you find your product id  you can enter it into sheet 1 eol and then hit the start button  you will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish

a word of caution  we will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used  for instance it has been brought to my attention that the product id s change each month as new prompt months roll on  thus the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right id  is linking up should always be verified especially on older files  nonetheless as we get comfortable with the tool i believe that it will provide some value on deals that require realtime pricing inputs

please let me know if you have any questionscomments  i can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes

the never ending saga of enrononline vs ngx continues

under our settle agreement with ngx we somehow agreed to provide ngx with a password and id that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the indexs that we are providing data to  as a temporary solution i created a filer under my master user id that gives them all physical name gas products one month and under  the problem is they can see the rest of month product bidoffer and the product descriptions of other enrononline products  

would it be possible to set up a password and user id for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to  or at a minimum have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login

call me when you get a chance 403 974  6733

so its time for monday night football and i was thinking about how youd hitting on some waitress at hooters  ahhhhh those were the days   how are things going  whats new in the world  things here seem to be running there course  remember the movie wall street where they arrest name fox for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end  well i think name might have worked here and the whole company seems to be coming down with him  i dont know if it is getting much press in canada but the mighty name has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat  we seem to have run out of cash and cant pay the bills  visa and mastercard are maxed out  its kind of got me soul searching and im trying to decided what to do next  i can stay where i am and wait and see what comes of the merger but its kind of like sticking with the expos no one is certain what the future is or i can try and jump ship catch on with another gas trading company but the problem is the grass is never as green on the other side of the fence  hence the soul searching and dilemma  anyway i just thought id drop you a note see how things are going  dolphins seem to be doing ok 62 life could be worse

im going to tampa bay for american thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off  and im coming to calgary for christmas  i get in late friday the 21st and head back to name sunday the 30th  maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day drinks at minimum  anyway i have to get back to work  i hope all is well in cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight

people down here are shocked  one of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit  all he said was that something blew up and he was getting the  out of there   sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower  he got out alright but many of his coworkers are still missing  lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves  as for meim wondering why i moved to this country  things here are ok but i question everyday whether or not i made the right decision  hopefully some good things start happening to me  so far i have lost money trading live with two cats i cant stand dont have a car to drive or any of my personal belongings and this country is on the verge of going to war  i figure things can only get better

hello everyone

it is time to get started in our quest to figure out the ne  given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage storage arbitrage and opportunities surrounding the injection season   having this in mind i think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility and i think that is columbia gas transmission  i am inviting everyone to attend a meeting tuesday at 300 location to follow to discuss the who what where when why and how   in preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe

1	we need the operational capabilities of the pipe   this should include major receipt points delivery points through put capability line pack balances and storage facilities both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties  expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have name meredith name or name could you please try to track down some of this info

2	we need to talk about trading and transacting in this region  proper contracts with the pipe what flexibility we have or could get transportation costs within the region etcname meredith name or name could you please try to track down some of this info

3	name players on the pipeline ldcs industrials power generators and production companies ie native production on the pipe name and name could you please gather this info

4	price curves and trading opportunities for the region  i will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion

please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed  i look forward to see you all on tuesday

good to hear from you  things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse  name keeps making headlines and not in a good way  it looks like the market is going to test the big e and make sure that we can handle a little adversity  life down here is ok i am still trying to get settled  living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has  i can not stand them and if i could find a way to make them disappear i would  cats are the most useless dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday

anyways ive been doing some fun things down here  i have gone to a couple of college football games  i saw texas am crush notre dame and the university of texas kill colorado  both games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so i cant complain   i also went to the grand prix of name  that day was also nice and it was fun to watch but as far as car races go it was not that exciting  the winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day  the two canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didnt go that well  other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable  hot and sticky its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo  you just dont feel clean when you get back inside

trading has been hard  ive been on a long cold spell and i need to turn it around soon  but it always looks its darkest before dawnbring on the light 

i hope everything is going well for you  sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful  usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school  good luck on you exams im sure youll do fine

namet worry with the 11gjs just as long as we have the proper volumes over here  also leap years are observed in the gas business  when working out the number of days on excel if you take the month in advance and subtract the current month it will give the correct number of days including leap years

heeelllloooo g money

long time no email  things here are starting to settle down a little  i still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there but ill be sure to give you more notice than last time as it will probably be less work and more play  i have yet to do anything too spectacular down here  last week end i went to the name grand prix  name tracey and the other canadian name fails meyou know the french guy name didnt do to well  although name had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap  it was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the thick of things  the day was nice and it beat being inside all day

a couple of week before that i watched notre dame get slaughtered by texas am  it was a really hot day and kyle field where am plays is the loudest outdoor stadium i have ever been in  there was 92000 people there and 91950 were die hard texas am fans  i kept pretty quite though the only thing i had to cheer about  as far as the irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss  everything else was down hill from thereit was a complete domination by am

the apartment is starting to get organized  it is hard to take two 2000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment  ive thrown a lot of stuff out i hope i wont need again or i hope i can replace easily if i need it

how are things with you  are you guys getting out much these days  anything new and exciting going on in your life

i hope all is well and i find myself missing you guys a lot  have one for me

hello

your right it has been a long time since we have chatted  things are a changen with my life

first i just got back from a little so called vacation where name and i drove from west palm beach to name  we did it over 3 days so it wasnt that bad  day one was a 10 hour hop from west palm to desitn fl  you would have loved name they have the most amazing sand on their beaches  it kind of reminds me of icing sugar  very white and has a very fine texture and i felt like i was sink right into the sand wwwholidayinndestincom  next stop was in new orleans which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good cajun food  it took about 6 hrs to get there from name but the traffic was not that bad  next stop was in name about 55 hrs from new orleans  by now im sure you have asked yourselfwhy did they do this drive  and the obvious answer is because name is moving there  she rented a really nice loft in down town name not far from name field httpastrosmlbcomnasappmlbhouballparkhouballparkhistoryjsp  she took a job with name energy service which is our retail company  the bad thing is im not sure how i feel about having her work for the same company the good thing is that she is in a different building than the wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low  i guess this would kind of be like if we worked for shell and i ran the bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration  not the same business but nonetheless for the same company

second  it look like i am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to name as well  believe it or not this was not by design just a mere coincident  however it has presented some tough questions  do i really want to move again and do i want to cohabitate  moving is the easy part im starting to become an expert and i was thinking about selling my house anyway  as for cohabitating the jury is still out  name would have no problem with the idea but cold feet mckay has mixed feeling  cohabiation is in the lead as it stands

third what would you prefer i do with some of the goodies you have let me borrow ie your beautiful dolls the cabinets the dolls are in the tv stand you mirror and the other few remaining items  i thought i would store the dolls at names but i was unsure as to what your preference was for the other things   i am going to sell everything i can and start over in name regardless my living plans the only thing im going to try to take is my car  if you want i can either try to get a fair price for you furniture or name might be able to make good use of the tv cabinet and other things  email me your phone number as i do not have it and we can talk about what is best

anyway good to hear you are getting some exercise i am trying to do the same and stay off the darts if you can  if you cannt reward yourself for trying

take care and i will talk to you in a couple of weeks

love

we tried

it is my understanding that five aep employees will in names offices starting may 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the hpl trading and to direct the hpl bidweek activities for june assuming close occurs for june  to protect names proprietary trading information for may and june i would like the aep employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 1030 am for the duration of their stay  from 730  1030 am is when the may business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with hpl employees

another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur june 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until july  who wears the risk positions  my suggestion is that if aep is going to set up hpl activities for june then they should wear the risk positions  the way to accomplish this is to do the following

	1  the initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point ie hsc or waha after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections

	2  volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400000d purchased on ifgmr hsc index related pricing will be sold to aep in the ground at june index 	      actual storage costs  volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to bammel storage

name

case 1
core term index position    100000d long  50000d waha 50000d texoma
thirty day index position    200000d long  volumes at thompsonville and name
total index position           300000d long

vols targeted for storage   200000d

name sells aep 200000d in storage at june ifgmr hsc index plus storage costs  any additional volumes would be sold to aep at july index  name sells 50000d gas daily swap at ifgmr waha and 50000d gas daily swap at ifgmr hsc

case 2
core term index position     200000 short 50000d waha 150000d hsc
thirty day index position     400000 long   50000d waha 100000d agua name 100000d thompsonville 150000d name
total index position            200000 long

vols targeted for storage    200000d

lets talk because i think it may make more sense to flip the other way  i was hoping to continue using name in the morning in the cash trading activities  so maybe he can run the texas risk group while trading phyical similar to what name is doing on the logistics side

name
 

name

i could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel  right now name farmer is evaluating an opportunity with aep  if he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts i may be in a situation that i have to do something with name  if name leaves then name is really the only one remaining with waha experience that is why i decided to move him to the desk  bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience name is definitely a keeper for risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if name leaves  needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but i thought you should be aware it particularly if i end up in a situation where i have to make more cuts

i am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what i am going through  i will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible dont completely put name out of your plans at this point  i have explained this situation to him and i think he understands given he is new to trading

any thoughts

kelley

given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for december so we have no trades to report this month  hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future  for whatever it is worth it that there are some unusual things happening in the fixed float markets in texas particularily at hsc  the nymex is down 10 cents today yet the hsc fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or 2336 to 2345 yesterday to now 236 with the name hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of 231 again in a falling market  we feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and gas daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially  i have no evidence since i was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all i am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration

thank you

could you send me an updated list of the traders remaining vacation days for 2001  i am hearing a lot of members of the desk wanting to get their vacation by the end of the year  i want to know what i am dealing with  try to include name and name as well

i did not know if you heard that name has agreed to settle the dispute over nng and will fullfill the earlier agreement to deliver the pipeline to dynegy  name has the right to  buy it back by june 30th  name will still proceed with the 10 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include nng in that suit  bottom line for now nng employees will become dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved andor unless name excercises its right to buy it back  i wonder if this will impact name and name

name

ps are you out of bed yet ya bum
 

an issue has come up that i did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for june should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not  physical deals for june have started to happen already  if close does occur and all the deals prior to may 18th are done as hpl then ena will miss out on a lot of potential business for june  so i believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to hpl ie agua name thompsonville oasis name lonestar name texoma be done as hpl deals in a location such as name tailgate that is relevant to hpl and ena will be split evenly hpl and ena and written up as two separate purchases  waha is not considered here since aep already has a waha trader who is active in the market

thanks

name
 

maybe we should meet  i am not sure what name has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change  my objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do  i told him that as he has time i could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job  the bottom line is that name is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading  i viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like  but i have no immediate plans to move name into trading  if the time ever comes that i would like bring him into trading i will certainly coordinate the transition with you  i was under the impression that name cleared all this with you before he moved  it appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than i intend at this time  how do you want to handle this

name
 

no she has not called  thanks you always seem to know the right thing to do  thanks for covering for me

name
 

it seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at klein oak or klein  i guess the question is how much have the pool fees gone up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air  who knows the prices

name
 

i am sorry that you are having problems with name  i am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school  it can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school  it sounds like name feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl  i know it is hard but some how you need to reassure name that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she name is less of your friend  maybe the best approach is to ask name how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met  you and name have been friends for a long time and you dont want to lose that but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her

to answer your question things are ok  there is still a lot of uncertainty with the dynegy and name merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon  all i can do is try to do the best job i can and let everything else work itself out

i am going to an nwal meeting tonight at 730 so i will see you probably about bed time

thanks for writing to me

since the majority of the division wants klein high school ill live with it  name miller had a good idea how about if we see if we can also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there  it is not as conveniently located to the pool as klein oaks gym is but at least it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day  what do you think

ps you either respond to this address work or the other address you have for me
 

name

a dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor  we have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment uncertain about future employment and now with new information about lays golden parachute i am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the company hero or zero attitude or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade  i hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the company similar to what was done when we sold hpl  the general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the little people that have been making the money for the company are left out in the cold  i also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year

i know the first move i suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100 commited to name  this may be too drastic action at this point but i think it should watched closely
 

just a heads up i lost name farmer as my logistics managertransportation person on thursday  i have asked name if he would be interested  he said he would give me an answer on monday

name
 

name

lavo has given me the idea that name redmond may not be part of netco and it is possible that the texas gas origination business may go away completely  i would like to talk to you before you make a final decision  i do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the east and central it is a source of information for the trading business  it is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market  my opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process  give me a call to discuss at 7138533079

you or name need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process expected timeline hurdles before start up again starting var and general organizational structure  people are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information  i know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individuals situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure

i agree  the traders need access only to the physcal trading systems  they are only trading next day physical gas for the remainder of may so they do not need access to any other systems

thanks

name
 

please forward the information to eddie leschber and laynie east  i know the origination was classified as gas assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group  if those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 1st and 2nd quarters need to move to gas assets  ask eddie and laynie how they want to handle it

thanks

if this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it  the potential upside of the entex audit is more like 2  3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving nonperformance  in the past ena and entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term  obviously we will not have that remedy  do not let aep separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death

name slone has been in contact with you on my behalf about a clerical error that occurred when i tried to roll my remaining esop shares into the 401 k plan back in the august to september time frame  she indicated that there may be reason to believe that i will be reimbursed for this error but you were waiting for further information on the matter  given that i will be going with the sale of the trading business to ubs in early to mid february i wanted to get this situation cleaned up by then if at all possible  what steps do we need to go through to get closure on this matter  is there anything i can do to help ie explain in person what happened

any explanation that you can give as to how and when this error gets fixed will be greatly appreciated

thanks

name
 

i left you a voicemail as well  i just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the esop rollover into savings plan ocurred as we discussed last week  i got into the savings plan on friday 1123 and moved the name shares to stable assets also as we discussed  it appears that the price used was mondays close of 401 instead of fridays close of 471

so where do we go from here  i am assuming per our previous meeting that whether 401 or 471 is used that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in september probably september 30th when the esop shares should have been put into the savings plan

please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this

the 29th is ok for me other than it is nx1 for natural gas  starting at 300 makes it possible but 400 would be better or even the 30th at 300 would be better  i am assuming that a lot of thought has gone in to picking this day and other conflicts exist  the other gas traders are going to have the same issue with this time so if it is the only time that works for everybody then ill be there at 300

i think last year anyway the bulkhead issue only affected relays as we started all individual events from the blocks and move the timers for 25 and 50 yard swims  no matter i am over the kein oak deal and moving on to klein just suggesting we look into the possibility of using their gym for the teams  i will talk to name about the rates and pass it on when we get  have a great weekend

my suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature  i am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other  if we must have meetingspresentations have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations  as far as where to go name san name or galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size  if you are ok with spending more the golfing fishing and spa activities in florida miami key west tampast name are great  also golfing rafting and spas in colorado would be good too

i dont have a strong preference for where we go but i do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other

i respect the fact that a mistake was made my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until november 20th to get it fixed  it seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago  so what are my options other than waiting until november 20th

i have it in my briefcase i just forgot to get it out  another slow day so far

i checked on the internet today about fanniemae and ginniemae per names comments the other day  i learned that ginniemae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for hud and fha loans  they are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans  fanniemae basically does the same thing but is a nongovernment owned company used to be government owned in 1967  both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country  so names friendrelative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area  based on some of the stories i read they tend to focus on really bad areas  my guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market  so to the extent there are hud or fha loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it  i had no idea what these two entities did kind of interesting

maybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that name uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people  then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples  when you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 15 people  my guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people pre hpl sale

i made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 2001 and my previous 2002 budget  the total impact is to increase the budget by 68000  i also was not sure what your rent technology and transportation amounts were supposed to represent  based on our previous discussions i thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere but i used your numbers anyway  i am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in

from my perspective the waha exxon name tailgate and the new carthage tailgate product should be converted to ena on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur june 1st  since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include aep directing hpl activities for june during bidweek if we determine that close will occur june 1st then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ena at the same time

name  the agreement calls for them to provide to ena certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ena under this agreement  a letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient  to the extent they dont provide this an early termination event occurs  we can still call for collateral in accordance with section 45 if they dont meet the thresholds  the item added in your sentence 1 below does concern me  this seems to be a floated revenue system and i am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there  i need to review these additions with colorado springs because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements  we probably need to get on a conference call with them

name  i reviewed the contract files on the hubbard transaction and found the following agreements

all these contracts are in name north america corps name

1  compression services agreement dated june 29 2000 i worked on this one  we basically restated the existing compression services agreement with nng to revise conversion factors to allow nng to deliver ena more gas and thus allow ena to mark more earnings  nng was able to book 2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ena to nng in consideration for termination of the existing compression services agreement  this agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by nng to ena for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities  no specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable

	no events of default specifically listed including bankruptcy  thus it is not terminated  if ena fails to provide hp there are ld payments due up to a maximum of 200000 per contract year  term is through january 31 2018

2  first amended and restated operations agreement dated november 1 1997  nng operates the electric driver for ena  fee is 44000 per year with an escalater  term is through november 30 2017 this works with the term of the csa above  even though physical operations stop in november gas still flows for another two month period  

	no events of default specifically listed including bankruptcy 

3  agreement for purchase of power dated march 31 1995 as amended on november 19 1997  ena purchases electricity from midland power cooperative  term is through december 31 2017

	no events of default specifically listed including bankruptcy 

4  master lease agreement dated march 31 1995  ena leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from general electric capital corporation this agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of 94487569

	bankruptcy of ena is an event of default  ge must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default  if they declare an event of default ge could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ena liable for the stipulated loss value of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder  the stipulated loss value calculated is set forth on a table attached to the agreement

let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements

i have reviewed the dow agreement wrt to the dow invoice dated november 29 2001 and have found the following

1  2q lease fee  115000
    3q lease fee  195500

section 33 of the agreement as amended provides for a lease fee of 25000 per bcf based on 46 bcf until the date that gas injections begin in names well which was july 31 2001 and a fee of 50000 per bcf based on 46 bcf thereafter  the fees are assessed per calendar quarter  the above fees look to be ok

2  final mining fee  2336240
     final land purchase offset  4701375

section 65 through 68 of the agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the brine fee due dow based on the amount of salt removed from names new well and a corresponding credit back to name for the conveyance of a 57865 acres tract of land to dow from name  the credit is also based on the amount of salt removed from names new well  dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 65 through 68 to verify the above charges

3  power credit adjustment  16500

i find no basis for this in the contract


under schedule 3 to the bridgeline holdings lp partnership agreement bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the dow agreement up to a maximum of 1000000 per year  so bridgeline should be paying these costs assuming they havent already paid up to 1000000

name  per our discussion attached are drafts of names master firm agreements  sorry for the delay  

  

names preference would be to use these master instead of the gisb agreements for the firm deals  the firm gtc were really meant as a stop gap until we could be these masters in place  i did review the gisb we currently have in place with northern states power wi and mn  these agreements do not have the necessary credit provisions and termination payment provisions required for firm deals that are included in our attached master  these masters should address the specific concerns included in your email

1  the masters contains provisions to deal wth the possibility that a price will not published on any day in the same manner as the gisb does
2  the netting issue we need to address  the gisb dont have netting provisions but we dont use gisb for any firm deals over 1 month in term  i am not sure i understand the regulatory issues with respect to netting  these master contain netting provisions  lets discuss once you have reviewed the masters
3  force majeure provisions are similar to the gtc  name prefers a vary narrow definition of fm  we modify the gisb fm to reflect this with special provisions  if you could provide specific comments we can address your issues
4  audit provisions are included in the masters
5  any affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions can be address in this master  if you could provide specific language we can address this issue

putting these master in place would really make business going forward much more efficient  please review and lets discuss and your earliest convenience  i can be reached at 713 8533512
 

name  i reviewed the form provided  some comments	

1  generally we should make every attempt to get these guys to use our paper  from an ena upstream overall standpoint if we start using other forms then we lose consistency with how these deals are administered payment noms etc  

2  with respect to this form there are some conceptual issues
	a  no specific measures of damages if the parties breach
	b  no detail on the type of gas being purchase ie wellhead pooling point firm interruptible  contract states that seller shall use reasonable efforts to deliver 	and buyer shall use reasonable efforts to purchase we would have to tie this down
	c  nomination deadlines and notification for production variances is not addressed

3  there are also some legal issues  state law arbitration etc indemnity

in summary we would have to make significant revisions to this form and it would end up looking much more like our form  i dont know the dynamics of the relationship  are they insistent on using their paper
 

name perelingiere had prepared this contract  since it was done so recently it may not have made it into the system yet thanks for your help  ill check names files
